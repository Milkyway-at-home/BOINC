   Note that some ftp sites may not yet have the latest versions of Zip
   and UnZip when you read this.  The latest versions always appear in
   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ (and subdirectories thereof) first,
   except for encryption sources and binaries, which always appear in
   ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/infozip/ (and subdirectories) first.

   IF YOU FIND AN ERROR:  please let us know!  We don't have time to
   check each and every site personally (or even collectively), so any
   number of the sites listed below may have moved or disappeared en-
   tirely.  E-mail to Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu and we'll update this file.

Info-ZIP's home WWW site is listed on Yahoo and is at:

   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/

The Zip and UnZip pages have links to most known mirror sites carrying our
source and/or binary distributions, and they generally are more up-to-date
and have better information than what you are reading:

   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/Zip.html
   http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZip.html

   zip11.zip         Zip 1.1 (shrinking, implosion; compatible w. PKUNZIP 1.1)
   zip11.tar.Z       ditto, compress'd tar format

   unzip540.zip      UnZip 5.4 (all methods[*]; unzip/funzip/unzipsfx/zipgrep)

   NOTE:  Look for the Info-ZIP file names given above (not PKWARE or third-

ftp/web sites for the encryption and decryption sources and/or executables:

   NOTE:  Non-US users, please do NOT ftp from the US sites (US regulations
   and all that).  Likewise, US users, please do not ftp from the European
   sites if it can be avoided (it's not illegal, but it is a waste of
   expensive trans-Atlantic bandwidth).

   From the US:
      ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/mirrors/garbo.uwasa.fi/arcers/

The primary distribution site for the MacZip port can be found at:

   http://www.sitec.net/maczip/

ftp sites for VMS-format Zip and UnZip packages (sources, object files and
executables, no encryption/decryption--see also "Mail servers" section below):

   ftp.spc.edu [192.107.46.27] and ftp.wku.edu:

   [.MACRO32]AAAREADME.TXT
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]UNZIP.BCK  or  UNZIP.ZIP  (if already have older version)
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]ZIP.ZIP

To find other ftp/web sites:

   The "archie" ftp database utility can be used to find an ftp site near
   you (although the command-line versions always seem to find old ver-
   sions...the `FTPsearch' server at http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/ftpsearch
   --formerly `Archie 95'--is quite up-to-date, however).  Or check a stan-
   dard WWW search engine like AltaVista (http://www.altavista.digital.com/)
   or Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com/).  If you don't know how to use these,
   DON'T ASK US--read the web sites' help pages or check the Usenet groups
   news.announce.newusers or news.answers or some such, or ask your system
   administrator.
