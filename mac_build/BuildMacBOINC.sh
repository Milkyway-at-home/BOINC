# Script for building Macintosh BOINC Manager, Core Client and libraries
# by Charlie Fenton 2/17/06
# with thanks to Reinhard Prix for his assistance
##

## Usage:
## cd to the mac_build directory of the boinc tree, for example:
##     cd [path]/boinc/mac_build
##
## then invoke this script as follows:
##      source BuildMacBOINC.sh [-dev] [-noclean] [-all] [-lib] [-client] [-help]
## or
##      chmod +x BuildMacBOINC.sh
##      ./BuildMacBOINC.sh [-dev] [-noclean] [-all] [-lib] [-client]
##
## optional arguments
## -dev         build the development (debug) version (native architecture only). 
##              default is deployment (release) version (universal binaries: ppc and i386).
##
## -noclean     don't do a "clean" of each target before building.
##              default is to clean all first.
##
##  The following arguments determine which targets to build
##
## -all         build all targets (i.e. target "Build_All" -- this is the default)
##
## -lib         build the three libraries: libboinc_api.a, libboinc_graphics_api.a, libboinc.a
##
## -client      build two targets: boinc client and command-line utility boinc_cmd
##              (also builds libboinc.a if needed, since boinc_cmd requires it.)
##
## Both -lib and -client may be specified to build five targets (no BOINC Manager)
##
