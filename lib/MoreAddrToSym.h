*** empty log message ***

Revision 1.2  2006/01/22 22:47:15  eskimo1
Significant rewrite to account for changes in MoreBacktrace.  Still not as functional as I'd like.

Revision 1.1  2003/04/04 15:03:00  eskimo1
First checked in.  This code still has bugs, but I've written enough code that checking in is a good idea.

// IMPORTANT:
// This code is currently broken in two ways:
// 
// o If the binary has debugging symbols, you often get a debugging 
//   symbol rather than a real symbol.  I believe this is caused by 
//   handling of N_FUN in the GetFunctionName routine.  Furthermore, 
//   I believe that it did work previous but something changed in the 
//   Mach-O headers to break it.  This warrants serious investigation. 
//
//   You can work around this problem by removing the debug symbols 
//   using:
//
//   $ strip -S YourBinaryName
//
// o It doesn't handle 64-bit Mach-O binaries.  This is a simple 
//   limitation of the code, and it should be relatively easy to fix.
//
// I intend to fix both of these problems with a future rewrite.  
// Until then, I've decided to live with them.
