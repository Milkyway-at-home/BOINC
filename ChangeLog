	* client/Makefile.am: update-boinc* references are replaced with
	../$(srcdir)/win, so that srcdir will be checked. update-boinc*
	files are added to EXTRA_DIST.

	* configure.ac: Check for ln -s.  This doesn't work perfectly, if
	"ln -s" is replaced with "cp -p", but the "ln -s" should probably
	be removed in the future.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): remove references to html_ops and
	html_user, which no longer exist.  UNIX2DOS now has path which
	includes quarl's unix2dos.  This should be changed, but not yet.

	* lib/util.C: added newline to end of file.
