	* client/cs_scheduler.C (handle_scheduler_reply): change
	traikle_ack to trickle_up_ack.

	* client/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): remove win/*.ico, since it
	doesn't exist there any more.

	* lib/sighandle.h, lib/sighandle.C: signal handling code, new
	files. 

	* lib/Makefile.am (libboinc_a_SOURCES): add sighandle.[Ch]. 

	* client/Makefile.am (boinc_client_LDADD): add ../lib/libboinc.a.
	Also add win/update-boinc* to EXTRA_DIST.

	* apps/Makefile.am (LDADD): add ../lib/libboinc.a

	* client/main.C, api/boinc_diagnostics.C, api/boinc_api.C: use
	boinc_set_signal rather than signal, so that signals are handled
	only when not already ignored.

	* configure.ac: check for signal type and sigaction.

	* client/Makefile.am: update-boinc* references are replaced with
	../$(srcdir)/win, so that srcdir will be checked. update-boinc*
	files are added to EXTRA_DIST.

	* configure.ac: Check for ln -s.  This doesn't work perfectly, if
	"ln -s" is replaced with "cp -p", but the "ln -s" should probably
	be removed in the future.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): remove references to html_ops and
	html_user, which no longer exist.  UNIX2DOS now has path which
	includes quarl's unix2dos.  This should be changed, but not yet.

	* lib/util.C: added newline to end of file.
