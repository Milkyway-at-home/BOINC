    - scheduler: scan_work_array(): if add_result_to_reply() fails, do NOT
        reinsert the entry in the array by resetting the "present" flag.
        We previously cleared this flag,
        so the array entry may have been refilled by the feeder,
        and it might be in the CHECKED_OUT state.

    - Nasty bug in API lib.  See checkin_nodes_2004 December 22. 
      Functions meant to be used from within C should never be
      declared bool!

      Fix: change boinc_is_standalone() to return int not bool.

      Note: some API functions still return bools, but since E@H
      doesn't use them and I am afraid of doing damage, I have
      left them alone.

    - Tweak the account manager system to support "farm managers"
        that use GUI RPC to control clients.
        The farm manager needs the GUI RPC port and password of each client.
        Add an optional <send_gui_rpc_info/> element to the
        acct_mgr_url.xml file,
        which causes the GUI RPC port and password to be included
        in account manager RPC requests.

David  6 Jan 2006
    - Change "bool" to "int" in the BOINC API.
        C and C++ compilers differ in their allocation for bool,
        making it difficult for C applications
        (which must be compiled with particular compilers)
        to use the BOINC API.
        No such problem for int.

            This is the host CPID sent in the previous AM request.
            It lets the AM track hosts even when their CPIDs change.
        - Include <domain_name> in AM request
        - AM replies can include <message> elements.
            The contents are printed in the Messages tab.

    - user web: show bbcode correctly for UOTD

    html/user/

Bruce 9 Jan 2006
    - fix bug on page that shows profile for a given user.  The total
      number of posts made by a given user is not shown correctly.

      The PHP code assumes that this number is given by user.posts.  However
      in html/inc/db_forum.inc, the value of user.posts is NOT
      incremented each time a user makes a new post (either starting
      a new thread or replying to an existing one).  For the moment, my
      the fix is to simply scan the database and count the number of posts by the
      user, to give the right value on the profile page.

      An alternative fix (which would be less DB intensive, overall)
      is to (1) fix db_forum.inc so that it properly increments user.posts and
      then (2) add an update_db.php script entry that correctly sets user.posts
      by counting the number of posts for each user.

    - Fixes to BOINC zip library from Carl Christensen. Carl says:
      "I found a problem with boinc_zip; it seems some Linux STL's
      aren't very nice about classes that are inherited from their
      objects on multiple use; or huge file lists that we use on CPDN.
      So I rewrite it to just use "straight" std::string's in a vector.
      It's fully backwardly compatible and seems to work fine."

    - Core client: add a flow control mechanism for the case where

        (otherwise we'll fill up the disk).
        The mechanism: don't start new results for a project
        that has > 2 uploads in progress.
        Note: this actually happens with Cunning Plan

    - core client: on file upload, always get file size (even if small file).
        Before the file upload handler checkin earlier today,
        this was actually a bug:
        if a client had uploaded part of a small file and then failed,
        it would never be able to upload the rest.
        But it was probably a bad idea in the first place,
        since 1 MB is a large file from the viewpoint of a modem user.

        Instead, use the PID of the scheduler process that
        has it checked out (as we're already doing for "reserved" slots)
        and let the feeder clean up slots checked out by dead processes.
    - several of the DB enumerate() function were returning
        1 or -1 (rather than ERR_DB_NOT_FOUND) when no results.

    - update_stats program.  Fix 'bug of omission' where member counts
      of teams are calculated but were not written back into the database.
      Also, change algorithm so that for hosts/teams/users, when the RAC
      (Recent Average Credit) values have decayed to exactly 0.0 (double
      precision) then neither expavg_credit nor expavg_time are updated.
      In this way, by looking at the value of expavg_time, you can see
      exactly WHEN the RAC decayed to zero.  This effectively indicates
      the 'drop-out-date' for the host/team/user.

    - On Windows use the System Event Notification Service to determine
        network connectivity instead of using InternetGetConnectedState
        since it was proving to be unreliable.
        
      NOTE: This is a big change on Windows.  SENS uses COM as it's
        communication infrastructure and so therefore boinc.dll now has
        to be regsvr32'ed before network notification messages will be
        sent to the client.  If, for whatever reason SENS isn't working
        we'll fall back to InternetGetConnectedState.

    -Mac: Improve GridRepublic release script so it uses sed commands 
      to convert standard BOINC plist, preinstall and preupgrade files 
      for Grid Republic; standard BOINC release script creates preupgrade 
      script by copying preinstall script;  these changes eliminate the 
      need for seven files I checked in earlier.
      Also generalize Grid Republic release script so it can easily be 
      modified for other brands by changing a few variable definitions.
      Changed name of GR Manager to "GridRepublic Manager" from just 
      "GridRepublic."
      Restore my change of 1/21/06 which was lost: manager determines 
      branding before launching client.  
      Remove mac_build/Installer-info.plist and replace with 
      mac_build/Installer-info.plist (CVS is case-sensitive).

    - core client: move code that deals with generating new host CPID
        to the end of handle_scheduler_reply(),
        after the part that clears sched_rpc_pending and sets min_rpc_time,
        since if we generate a new host CPID
        we're going to modify these (to request another RPC).
        Also: in this case request an immediate scheduler RPC to all projects
        whether or not we're using an account manager.
    - core client: if detach from account manager,
        clear "attached_via_acct_mgr" flag on all projects

        from text (64KB limit)
