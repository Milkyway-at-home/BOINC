    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_CONFIG
        (corresponding to the get_project_config.php web RPC):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
        - sched_stopped: scheduler disabled
        - web_stopped: DB-driven web features disabled
        - min_client_version
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to CC_STATE:
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the client
            (this replaces the unused <platform_name>)
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (entry in the "all projects" list):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
    - GUI RPC: move APP_VERSION pointer from WORKUNIT to RESULT;
        include plan class in APP_VERSION lookup.
        This completes the change of March 2008,
        and allows the Manager to work correctly when a project
        has two different app versions of the same (app, platform, version)
        running on a client at once (e.g., a CPU and a GPU app)

    - STILL WORK TO BE DONE TO GET locale STUFF INSTALLED PROPERLY!!!
    - Update to libtool 1.5.24
    - build environment:  Major automake changes that I've been warning about
      for some time.
    - Now uses libtool to build libraries.
    - Builds separate boinc_fcgi and sched_fcgi libraries for use with 
      FCGI server components.
    - New macro "BOINC_CHECK_LIB_WITH" that executes a "AC_CHECK_LIB" on
      a library only if --with-libname[=DIR] is specified on the configure
      command line.  This is to allow inclusion of libraries when the 
      ssl, gtk, wxWidgets, or other configuration is incorrect for static
      libraries.
    - Added a lot of "--with-*" for some libraries that might be required for
      static builds.
    - The sea directory has been moved to packages/generic.  Changes to sea
      and the associated scripts might be required to better make use of the
      staging mechanism and shared libraries.
    - Fixed includes of boinc_fcgi.h in many files.
    - Fixed places where FCGI_FILE needs to be used implicitly.
    - Fixed missing define of _SC_PAGESIZE on hosts that define only
      _SC_PAGE_SIZE.
    - Moved build of boinc_cmd (and source file) from lib to client

David  30 Jan 2009
    - Work fetch / scheduler:
        There are two mechanisms to prevent the scheduler from
        sending jobs that won't finish by their deadline.
        Simple mechanism:
            The client sends the interval x for which CPUs are projected
            to be saturated.
            Given a job with estimated duration y,
            the scheduler doesn't send it if x + y exceeds the delay bound.
            If it does send it, x is incremented by y.
        Complex mechanism:
            Client sends workload description.
            Scheduler does EDF simulation, sees if deadlines are missed.
            The only project using this AFAIK is BOINC alpha test.
        Neither of these mechanisms takes coprocessors into account,
        and as a result jobs could be sent that are doomed to
        miss their deadline.
        This checkin adds coprocessor awareness to the Simple mechanism.

        Changes:
        Client:
            compute estimated delay (i.e. time until non-saturation)
            for coprocessors as well as CPU.
            Send them in scheduler request as part of coproc descriptor.
        Scheduler:
            Keep track of estimated delays separately for different resources
    - client: fixed bug that computed CPU estimated delay incorrectly
    - client: the work request (req_secs) for a resource is the min
        of the project's share and the shortfall.

David  31 Jan 2009
    - client: there was a problem with how the round simulator
        worked in the presence of coprocessors.
        The simulator maintained per-project queues of pending jobs.
        When a job finished (in the simulation) it would get
        one or more jobs from that project's pending queue.

        The problem: this could cause "holes" in the scheduling of GPUs,
        and produce an erroneous nonzero shortfall for GPUs,
        leading to infinite work fetch.

        The solution: maintain a separate (per-resource, not per--project)
        queue of pending coprocessor jobs.
        When a coprocessor job finishes,
        start pending jobs from the queue for that resource.

        Another change: the simulator did strict reservation of coprocessors.
        If there are 2 instances of CUDA,
        and a 1-instance job is running in the simulation,
        it wouldn't start an additional 2-instance job.
        This also can cause erroneous nonzero shortfalls.

        So instead, schedule coprocessors like CPUs, i.e. saturate them.
        This can cause distorted completion time estimates,
        but it's better than infinite work fetch.

Charlie 20 Feb 2009
    - screensaver: Implement new screensaver coordinator logic as requested by Rom:
        If the coordinator cannot connect to the core client:
            - coordinator retries connecting every 10 seconds 
            - coordinator launches the default graphics application with the 
                argument --retry_connect, so the default graphics app will continue 
                running and will also retry connecting every 10 seconds.
        If the coordinator successfully connected to the core client, it launches the 
            default graphics application without the argument --retry_connect.  If the 
            default graphics application can't connect, it will return immediately 
            with the exit code ERR_CONNECT.  In that case, the coordinator assumes 
            the default graphics app was blocked by a firewall and so the coordinator 
            will run only project (science) graphics.

    - client: new work-fetch policy:
        1) if an instance is idle, get work from highest-debt project,

        2) if resource has a shortfall, get work from highest-debt
            non-overworked project
        3) if there's a fetchable non-overworked project with no runnable jobs,
            get from from the highest-debt one.
        (each step is done first for GPU, then CPU)
        Clause 3) is new.
        It will cause the client to get jobs for as many projects as possible,
        even if there is no shortfall.
        This is necessary to make the notion of "overworked" meaningful
        (otherwise, any project with long jobs can become overworked).
        It also maintains as much variety as possible (like pre-6.6 clients).

        Also (small bug fix) if a project is overworked for resource R,
        request work for R only in case 1).

    - WINSCR: Fix the BOINC text displayed is the screensaver control
        panel applet
    - WINSCR: Get rid of the 'Up to 5 second wait' for the data thread
        to terminate.  Force terminate the thread and clean up the
        graphics app in a clean-up routine.  Forcing the user to wait
        when they return to the system isn't a good idea.
    - WINSCR: Fix screensaver issue where the screensaver locks up
        when the graphics application deadlocks for one reason or
        another.
        
        Create two new threads:
          1. Monitor system for keyboard and mouse events.
          2. Shuffle window z-order positions if needed.
          
        The keyboard/mouse event monitor is isolated from either
          the core client getting stuck in a loop and not returning
          the results of an RPC or the window shuffling code which
          can get stuck if the graphics application dead locks.
          
        The window shuffle code is isolated due to the
          BroadcastSystemMessage() API using something akin to
          SendMessage() which waits for a return value from the
          target windows winproc.  If a graphics application
          deadlocks for one reason or another it'll cause
          the thread to stall.  This isn't terminal and so we
          just wait for the next time the data thread chooses
          a new application and terminates the old one which
          will cause the thread to resume.
          
        This should resolve all outstanding issues with the
          screensaver not exiting when the mouse or keyboard
          is used.

    TODO: the whole proxy info thing needs an overhaul:
    - no separate "use_XXX" flags;

    - Added checks for net/*.h, arpa/*.h, netinet/*.h and code to figure out
      which of those files to include
    - Modified MAC address check to work on some non-Linux unixes.
      (mac_address.cpp)
    - Added suggested change to "already attached to project" checking.
      (ProjectInfoPage.cpp)
    - changed includes of standard c header files to their c++ equivalents
      (i.e. replaced <stdio.h> with <cstdio>) for namespace protection.
    - replaced "using namespace std;" with more explicit "using std::function" in
      several files.
    - Fixed bug in checking whether the os is OS/2 and added conditional OS_OS2
      to the build environment. (boinc_platform.m4,configure.ac)
    - Changed build environment to not use -nostandardlibs unless we are using
      G++ and static linkage is specified. (configure.ac)
    - Added makefiles and package building files for solaris CSW package manager.
    - Fixed bug with attempting to find login name using logname. (configure.ac)
    - Added ifdef HAVE_* protection around some include files commonly found in
      sys.
    - Added support for unified binary for x86_64/i686-pc-solaris.
      (cs_platforms.cpp)
    - generate_host_cpid() now uses MAC address on non-linux unix.
      (hostinfo_network.cpp)
    - Macro BOINC_SET_COMPILE_FLAGS now doesn't check gcc only flags on non-gcc
      compilers. (boinc_set_compile_flags.m4)
    - Library compiles no longer depend upon the library extension or require
      the library to be prefixed with lib.
    - More fixes for fcgi builds.
    - Added declaration of "struct ether_addr" and ether_ntoa().  Have not yet
      implemented ether_ntoa() for machines that don't have it, or where it is
      buggy.  (unix_util.h)
    - Added FCGI::perror() which calls FCGI_perror(). (boinc_fcgi.{h,cpp})

David  27 Feb 2009
    - client: fix bug that could cause scheduler RPC
        to ask for work inappropriately,
        and tell user that it wasn't asking for work.
        Here's what was going on:
        There are two different structures with work request fields
        (req_secs, req_instances, estimated_delay):
        COPROC_CUDA *coproc_cuda
        and
        RSC_WORK_FETCH cuda_work_fetch.
        WORK_FETCH::choose_project() copied from cuda_work_fetch to coproc_cuda,
        but only if a project was selected.
        WORK_FETCH::clear_request() clears cuda_work_fetch but not coproc_cuda.

        Scenario:
        - a scheduler op is made to project A requesting X>0 secs of CUDA
        - later, a scheduler op is made to project B for reason
            other than work fetch (e.g., user request)
        - choose_project() doesn't choose anything,
            so the value of coproc_cuda->req_secs remains X
        - clear_request() is called but that doesn't change *coproc_cuda

        Solution: work-fetch code no longer knows about internals of
            COPROC_CUDA and is not responsible for settings its request fields.
            The copying of request fields from RSC_WORK_FETCH to COPROC
            is done at a higher level,
            in CLIENT_STATE::make_scheduler_request()

        Additional bug fix: estimated_delay wasn't being cleared in some cases.

    - client: don't allow coproc apps in app_info.xml.
        Otherwise we'll get stuck in a loop where the client asks for CPU work,
        and the scheduler sends jobs for what it thinks is a CPU app
        but is actually a coproc app.

        Eventually we should add coproc info to the app descriptions
        send in scheduler request,
        so that you can use anonymous platform for coproc apps.
        But let's wait on this.

    - scheduler: add support for anonymous-platform coproc apps.
        Old: although the request message contained all info
            about the app version (flops, coproc usage etc.)
            the server ignored this info,
            and assumed that all anonymous platform apps where CPU.
            With 6.6 client, this could produce infinite work fetch:
            - client uses anon platform, has coproc app
            - client has idle CPU, requests CPU work
            - scheduler sends it jobs, thinking they will be done by CPU app
            - client asks for more work etc.
        New: scheduler parses full info on anon platform app versions:
            plan class, FLOPS, coprocs.
            It uses this info to make scheduling decisions;
            in particular, if the request is for CUDA work,
            if will only send jobs that use a CUDA app version.
            The <result> records it returns contain info
            (plan_class) that tells the client which app_version to use.
        This will work correctly even if the client has multiple app versions
        for the same app (e.g., a CPU version and a GPU version)

        on a per-thread basis, such as OS 10.3.9.

    - WINSCR: It appears newer notebook models with multiple video
        chipsets exhibit an interesting situation.  It appears as though
        in certain conditions a single monitor machine actually reports
        itself as having three monitors.  Normally the monitor that
        contains the primary window (coord 0,0) is on monitor 0, but on
        these machines coord 0,0 is actually on monitor 2.  This led to the
        screensaver not properly exiting when keyboard and/or mouse activity
        was detected.  Now when we detect that keyboard and/or mouse activity
        has happened we send the WM_INTERRUPTSAVER event to all windows
        on all monitors.

    - client: instead of scheduling coproc jobs EDF:
        - first schedule jobs projected to miss deadline in EDF order
        - then schedule remaining jobs in FIFO order
        This is intended to reduce the number of preemptions of coproc jobs,
        and hence (since they are always preempted by quit)
        to reduce the wasted time due to checkpoint gaps.
    - client: the CPU scheduling policy made use of the number
        of deadline misses in various places.
        This should include only the deadline misses of CPU jobs.
        So move "deadlines_missed" from RR_SIM_STATUS and PROJECT
        to RSC_PROJECT_WORK_FETCH so that we have separate counts
        for CPU and coproc jobs, and use the count for CPU jobs.

    - client: new approach to handling multiple GPUs.
        old: find fastest GPU, and pretend that others are the same.
            Problem: other GPUs might be less capable,
            and not able to handle jobs sent by server.
        new: find the most "capable" GPU, use others that are equivalent,
            don't use those that are not.
            "Capable" is defined by
            - compute capability (i.e., hardware version)
            - driver version
            - memory size
            - FLOPs
            in that priority order.

    - client, Mac: don't do res_init().  It causes a crash.
    - client (Unix): if client crashes while benchmark processes are going,
        make sure they detect this and exit.
    - back-end programs: remove hardwired assumptions about
        what directory they run in, and hence where config.xml is.
        E.g., daemons look for it in "..", others expect it in current dir.
        New approach: all the programs look for the project dir as follows:
        1) the environment var BOINC_PROJECT_DIR, if defined
        2) the current dir, if config.xml is there.
        3) else ".."
        This means you can run programs in either proj/bin/ or proj/,
        or (using BOINC_PROJECT_DIR) you can keep executables
        outside of the project dir.

    - scheduler: add <report_max> config parameter;
        limits the # of completed results handled per scheduler RPC.
        This may be needed to avoid crashes due to memory allocation
        failure (each reported result uses about 128KB memory).
    - web: In showing result lists,
        include "Validate error" results in the "Invalid" category.
        (Previously they didn't appear in any category)

    - MGR: Finish merging "Attach to account manager" functionality into "Attach 
        to project" wizard: "Synchronize with account Manager" and "Remove from 
        account manager." Remove the obsolete classes and files.
        NOTE: The "Remove from account manager" functionality in the wizard 
        (action == ACCOUNTMANAGER_DETACH) was no longer used, so I removed this 
        block of code.
