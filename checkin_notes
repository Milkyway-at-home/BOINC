    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
	(platform name comes from configure)

    - Allow applications to have multiple files
        (e.g. scripts, libraries, pre- and post-processing programs).
        The app_version table now has an xml_doc field,
        which contains a list of <file_info> and <file_ref> elements.
        Note: the utility for adding applications (tools/add.C)
        still handles only single-file applications.
    - Changed IO_FILE_DESC to FILE_REF since it now represents
        an association of a file to workunit, result or application
