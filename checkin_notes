    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
	(platform name comes from configure)

    - Allow applications to have multiple files
        (e.g. scripts, libraries, pre- and post-processing programs).
        The app_version table now has an xml_doc field,
        which contains a list of <file_info> and <file_ref> elements.
        Note: the utility for adding applications (tools/add.C)
        still handles only single-file applications.
    - Changed IO_FILE_DESC to FILE_REF since it now represents
        an association of a file to workunit, result or application

    - Change the scheduling server to reduce database accesses.
        There's now a shared-memory segment that contains
        1) the platform, app, and app_version tables in their entirety;
        2) a fixed-size set of results ready to be sent,
            and their corresponding workunit.
        This segment is initialized and maintained by a new program
        called the "feeder" (sched/feeder.C) that should run
        whenever the scheduling server is up.
        Note: the scheduler still needs to be converted to fast CGI
    - Added handy interfaces for dealing with shared memory and semaphores.
    - Changed to utilities and scripts used for testing so that all
        server-specific names (paths and URLs) come from environment
        variables instead of being hardwired in the code.
        You'll want to add these to your .tcshrc or whatever.
        See the doc/install.html for details.
