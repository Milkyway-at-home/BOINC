        Same semantics, but the former is less efficient.
    - simplified Bruce's recent fix to escape_string()

    - scheduler: scan_work_array(): if add_result_to_reply() fails, do NOT
        reinsert the entry in the array by resetting the "present" flag.
        We previously cleared this flag,
        so the array entry may have been refilled by the feeder,
        and it might be in the CHECKED_OUT state.

    - Nasty bug in API lib.  See checkin_nodes_2004 December 22. 
      Functions meant to be used from within C should never be
      declared bool!

      Fix: change boinc_is_standalone() to return int not bool.

      Note: some API functions still return bools, but since E@H
      doesn't use them and I am afraid of doing damage, I have
      left them alone.

    - feeder: exit on database errors.
        This is a workaround for a problem where the
        feeder loses its DB connection after 10-20 hours of idleness.
        With this change, the feeder will exit, and will be restarted by cron.

    - Tweak the account manager system to support "farm managers"
        that use GUI RPC to control clients.
        The farm manager needs the GUI RPC port and password of each client.
        Add an optional <send_gui_rpc_info/> element to the
        acct_mgr_url.xml file,
        which causes the GUI RPC port and password to be included
        in account manager RPC requests.

David  6 Jan 2006
    - Change "bool" to "int" in the BOINC API.
        C and C++ compilers differ in their allocation for bool,
        making it difficult for C applications
        (which must be compiled with particular compilers)
        to use the BOINC API.
        No such problem for int.

    - Account manager additions (from Willy de Zutter)
        - Include <previous_host_cpid> in AM request.
            This is the host CPID sent in the previous AM request.
            It lets the AM track hosts even when their CPIDs change.
        - Include <domain_name> in AM request
        - AM replies can include <message> elements.
            The contents are printed in the Messages tab.
        - Print message that AM request has succeeded (or failed)

    - user web: show bbcode correctly for UOTD

    html/user/
        sample_index.php

Bruce 9 Jan 2006
    - fix bug on page that shows profile for a given user.  The total
      number of posts made by a given user is not shown correctly.

      The PHP code assumes that this number is given by user.posts.  However
      in html/inc/db_forum.inc, the value of user.posts is NOT
      incremented each time a user makes a new post (either starting
      a new thread or replying to an existing one).  For the moment, my
      the fix is to simply scan the database and count the number of posts by the
      user, to give the right value on the profile page.

      An alternative fix (which would be less DB intensive, overall)
      is to (1) fix db_forum.inc so that it properly increments user.posts and
      then (2) add an update_db.php script entry that correctly sets user.posts
      by counting the number of posts for each user.

    - Fixes to BOINC zip library from Carl Christensen. Carl says:
      "I found a problem with boinc_zip; it seems some Linux STL's
      aren't very nice about classes that are inherited from their
      objects on multiple use; or huge file lists that we use on CPDN.
      So I rewrite it to just use "straight" std::string's in a vector.
      It's fully backwardly compatible and seems to work fine."

    - Core client: add a flow control mechanism for the case where
        output files are generated faster than they can be uploaded
        (otherwise we'll fill up the disk).
        The mechanism: don't start new results for a project
        that has > 2 uploads in progress.
        Note: this actually happens with Cunning Plan
        (5 MB output files, 60 sec CPU) over a DSL line
