    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_CONFIG
        (corresponding to the get_project_config.php web RPC):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
        - sched_stopped: scheduler disabled
        - web_stopped: DB-driven web features disabled
        - min_client_version
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to CC_STATE:
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the client
            (this replaces the unused <platform_name>)
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (entry in the "all projects" list):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
    - GUI RPC: move APP_VERSION pointer from WORKUNIT to RESULT;
        include plan class in APP_VERSION lookup.
        This completes the change of March 2008,
        and allows the Manager to work correctly when a project
        has two different app versions of the same (app, platform, version)
        running on a client at once (e.g., a CPU and a GPU app)
    - get_project_config.php: remove logic that checks client version.

        RESULT contains version_num, plan_class

    - STILL WORK TO BE DONE TO GET locale STUFF INSTALLED PROPERLY!!!
    - Update to libtool 1.5.24
    - build environment:  Major automake changes that I've been warning about
      for some time.
    - Now uses libtool to build libraries.
    - Builds separate boinc_fcgi and sched_fcgi libraries for use with 
      FCGI server components.
    - New macro "BOINC_CHECK_LIB_WITH" that executes a "AC_CHECK_LIB" on
      a library only if --with-libname[=DIR] is specified on the configure
      command line.  This is to allow inclusion of libraries when the 
      ssl, gtk, wxWidgets, or other configuration is incorrect for static
      libraries.
    - Added a lot of "--with-*" for some libraries that might be required for
      static builds.
    - The sea directory has been moved to packages/generic.  Changes to sea
      and the associated scripts might be required to better make use of the
      staging mechanism and shared libraries.
    - Fixed includes of boinc_fcgi.h in many files.
    - Fixed places where FCGI_FILE needs to be used implicitly.
    - Fixed missing define of _SC_PAGESIZE on hosts that define only
      _SC_PAGE_SIZE.
    - Moved build of boinc_cmd (and source file) from lib to client

    The above two changes are intended to allow the QCN app to
    run at above_idle priority, which it needs in order to do 500Hz polling.
