    - client: use std::deque instead of std::vector
        for RR sim's pending-job lists.
        Erasing head of vector is slow.
    - lib: allow GPU peak FLOPS to be specified in XML (for simulator)
    - simulator work
    - client: old work fetch policy: projects may need enough jobs
        for all device instances, not just resource_share*ninst.
        E.g. a project that has only CPU jobs in a CPU/GPU client
    - client: with REC scheduling, don't ask for work for
        secondary resources if project has negative priority.
    - client: in RR sim, make sure we saturate devices if possible.
        Otherwise we may report a shortfall incorrectly

    - client: set PROJECT::last_upload_start when a job completes,
        NOT when its first upload starts.
        This prevents a scheduler RPC from happening between the two.
        This was a bug in [22841]

    - MGR: Disable the background repaint events for the SGUI Messages and
        SGUI Preferences dialog.  Changing the font color wasn't as easy as
        I had hoped and the black background for the skin doesn't do any
        good when the text itself is black as well.

    - unix build system: generate_svn_version
      - generate version string from plain git repositories, too
      - define SVN_REPOSITORY (URL) and SVN_REVISION (numerical) separately
        so these could be used in proprocessor directives
