    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages

        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Client: add <run_apps_manually> config flag.
        This is for debugging apps (currently works only in Unix).
        What it does: when running an app,
        the client does everything except actually fork/exec the app,
        i.e. it sets up the slot dir, creates shared mem segment etc.
        It then continues as if the app were actually running,
        and you can then manually run your app under a debugger
        in the slot directory.
        Note: the client won't notice the termination of your app.
    - API, Unix: in situations where the timer thread wants to exit
        (e.g. it notices a missing heartbeat).
        don't directly call boinc_exit(),
        since this touches data structures that the worker thread
        may be using concurrently.
        Instead, set a flag telling the worker thread to call boinc_exit()
        (which it will do from its signal handler)
        This is an attempt to fix problems reported by Bernd;
        I haven't tested it.

        It didn't work on a host's first scheduler RPC

        How do we look up user in this case?
        The weak auth is not stored explicitly in the DB.

    - client: a project (Ralph) had accidentally included a .svn directory in a zip archive,
        resulting in a lot of read-only files in its slot directories.
        When the client attempts to delete these files,
        each delete fails and the client retries for about 5 seconds.
        This adds up to a delay of about 20 minutes,
        during which the client (and Manager) appear to be hung.

        Solution:
        1) if a file delete fails with error ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED,
            use SetFileAttributes() to clear the read-only flag, then try again.
        2) Don't use the 5-second retry mechanism when clearing out
            slot directories.  These can contain unbounded numbers of files,
            and this can lead to long periods where the client appears hung.

    - web: fixed screwed-up UOTD logic.
        The meaning of the <screen_profiles> config flag is:
        If set:
            profiles must be screened by admins before their photo is shown.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
            (and they become eligible to be UOTD)
        If not set:
            profile photos are always shown.
            Profiles must be screened by admins before
            they are eligible for UOTD.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
        So default_uotd_candidates_query() is the same in either case.

        Hopefully this will fix a race condition
        where WU results get sent to different HR classes.
        (Alternatively we could use transactions,
        or acquire the semaphore during read/update,
        but this could impact performance).

    - MGR: Allow multiple selections in Transfers grid view only 
        (requested by Jorden van der Elst).  The Transfers tab is 
        the only grid view where the buttons did work properly with 
        multiple selections, so there is no reason to disable it.
        The other tabs disabled all buttons when multiple items were 
        selected, so allowing multiple selections was confusing to 
        users.
    - MGR: When order of rows in grid views changes (due to sorting or 
        changes in data), reselect the same data in the rearranged rows
        using:
            Projects tab: project name only
            Tasks tab: project name and work unit (task) name
            Transfers tab: project name and file name
            Messages tab: sequence number only.
    - MGR: set m_bForceUpdateSelection=true when deleting rows from grid 
        views.  Fixes bug: if the last row was selected and is deleted, 
        the new last row is automatically selected but the buttons were 
        not updated to reflect the new selection.

    - MGR: Fully implement support for multiple selections in Tasks 
        and Projects grid views.  Handles conflicts as follows:
          - Disables buttons which change functions (Suspend / Resume, 
            No New Tasks / Allow New Tasks) if user selects a mix of 
            items inconsistent with either function.  
          - Disables any buttons (Show Graphics, Abort) which would be 
            disabled for any one of the selected items.
          - Disables and hides project web site buttons if items from 
            more than one project are selected.
          - For operations which require confirmation (Abort, Reset,
            Detach) asks in a separate dialog for each selected item. 
            User can answer NO to some and YES to others and it will 
            perform the operation only on those with a YES response.
        - Added two defines: PREVENT_MULTIPLE_TASK_SELECTIONS and 
            PREVENT_MULTIPLE_PROJECT_SELECTIONS in the corresponding 
            header files.  Both are currently defined false.  Define 
            these as true to restrict that tab to single-selections.

    Various changes from Kevin Reed/WCG:
    - server: add workunit.rsc_bandwidth_bound: if nonzero,
        send this WU only to hosts with that much download bandwidth
    - assimilators: if a handler returns DEFER_ASSIMILATION,
        the WU remains in INIT state and will be handled when the
        next instance completes.
        Useful if you want the assimilator to see all instances.
    - scheduler: when setting result.outcome = DETACHED,
        set received_time to now
    - scheduler: removed the reliable_time and reliable_min_avg_credit
        options
    - scheduler/web: add optional <allow_non_preferred_projects>
        in project preferences.
        If present, user will accept work from non-selected apps
        if no work is available for selected apps
    - scheduler: improved messages for projects with multiple apps
    - scheduler: added config options
        <granted_credit_weight> and <granted_credit_ramp_up>.
        Used in calculating host.claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        but I'm not sure how.

        The new field (workunit.rsc_bandwidth_bound)
        goes at the END of the record.
        Always do it this way!
    - make_work: after creating a batch of new WUs,
        we were waiting 60 sec for the transitioner to
        create the results for them
        (so that our next count of unsent results would be correct).
        This is bogus; if e.g. the transitioner isn't running,
        we'll never get the results, and we'll keep creating WUs forever.

        Instead: explicitly wait for there to be results for
        the last WU from the batch just created.

    Various preparation for handling multithreaded apps
    and apps that use coprocessors.
    There now can be several app_versions for the same
    (app, platform, version_num) combination.
    This changes a number of things.

    - Added app_version.plan_class field to DB
    - update_versions now looks for a :plan-class in the
        file or directory name, and puts it in the app_version's DB record
    - Change uniqueness constraint to include plan_class
    - Feeder: the feeder was putting non-deprecated app_versions
        in shared mem, and leaving it to the scheduler to
        find the latest version for a given platform.
        This is dumb.
        Instead, for each app/platform pair the feeder now
        finds the highest version number of a non-deprecated app version,
        and enumerates all non-deprecated app_versions with that
        app/platform/version
    - Scheduler: add a BEST_APP_VERSION data structure that keeps track,
        for each app, what the best app_version is for this host.
        This saves the work of recomputing it for each job.

        under OS 10.5 or later, continue to use older code on earlier 
        systems without these APIs.
    - Mac: Change back to saving unstripped Client and Manager executables for 
        symbol tables rather than separate .dSYM files, which cannot be loaded 
        by atos command-line utility.  This also lets user substitute the 
        unstripped executable into application bundle to get backtraces with 
        symbols when debugging a crash in the field.  Set visibility of all 
        variables in Client and Manager to not be hidden so they appear in

    - client (Unix): use symbolic links instead of XML link files.
        This will allow applications to access shared libraries
        by their logical names,
        which simplifies things when you have multiple platforms,
        and the apps (or libraries) refer to shared libraries
        by names that don't include the platform.
        This shouldn't impact the API - boinc_resolve_filename()
        will open the file, see that it's not an XML link file,
        and the symbolic link will be used directly.
        At some point we can change boinc_resolve_filename() on Unix
        to be a no-op if the client is 6.2+
    - client (Unix):
        Append the slot dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    - update_versions: added a feature where you can put a file
        "extra_xml" in the app dir, and it will get included in
        the app versions's xml_doc.

    - Client: fix  a compiler warning which indicated a real logic error
        (variable used uninitialized).
    - Mac: More work on backtrace code: run atos utility via a bidirectional
        pipe instead of backtrace_symbols_fd() API to get better symbols
        in backtrace.  
        Set visibility of all variables in Client and Manager back to hidden
        (as before) to reduce size of executables,
        since atos utility can use hidden symbols.
        This also involves return to previous wxWidgets build script.

Charlie Mar 21 2008
    - Mac: More sandbox security changes for symlinks: lchown is not available 
        under OS 10.3.9, so don't use it.  The system ignores ownership and 
        permissions of symbolic links, so setprojectgrp does nothing if it is  
        called for a symbolic link.  
        Also make additional changes to check_security and SetupSecurity.

    Changes for multithread app support:

    - update_versions: use __ (not :) as separator for plan class
    - client: add plan_class to APP_VERSION;
        an app version is now identified by platform/version/plan_class
    - client CPU scheduler: don't assume apps use 1 CPU
    - client: add avg_ncpus, max_cpus, flops, cmdline to RESULT
    - scheduler: implement app planning scheme

    Other changes:

    - client: if symlink() fails, make a XML soft link instead
        (for Unix running off a FAT32 FS)
    - client: don't accept nonpositive resource share from AMS
    - daemons and DB: check for error returns from enumerations,
        and exit if so.  Thus, if the MySQL server goes down,
        all the daemons will soon exit.
        The cron script will restart them every 5 min,
        so when the DB server comes back up so will the project.
    - web: show empty max CPU % as ---
    - API: get rid of all_threads_cpu_time option (always the case now)

    - server and client:
        in server->client reply messages and in the client itself,
        move app-planning info from RESULT to APP_VERSION.
        This was necessary to allow anonymous platform info (app_info.xml)
        to specify avg_ncpus, etc.
        e.g., if someone wants to write a multithread version of SETI@home,
        or a GPU/CUDA version,
        they can run it using the anonymous platform mechanism
        and it will be scheduled correctly.

        If a server sends an existing APP_VERSION but with different
        app-planning info, the client will accept and use the new info.

    - Build fixes for non-Win32, non-Linux, non-MacOS systems.
    - configure script: 
        - Added checks for functions strdup(), strdupa(), 
            daemon(), stat64(), strcasestr()
        - Fixed problems with kc_mysql.m4 and wxWidgets.m4 returning
        invalid CFLAGS and LIBS flags.
    - Fixed incorrect order of pthread flag checking on solaris.
    - New files: lib/unix_util.[Ch].  Currently contains implementation of
        daemon() for systems that lack it.
    - Access to binary files in /proc was failing on some systems when compiled
        with 64 bit file access.  Rearranged headers and defines to force 32bit
        file access in hostinfo_unix.C
    - all_tty_idle() didn't work as advertised on any system as far as I can
        tell.  I rewrote it to check ttys that are not named /dev/tty[1-9].
        The old implementation was modifying a statically allocated read-only
        string, anyway.
    - added implementation of non-standard function strcasestr() to str_util.C
    - added #define of MAP_FILE to shmem.C, because it is missing from most
        unix systems, (and is unnecessary on linux anyway).
    - other minor bug fixes.

    - API: change boinc_resolve_filename() so that it detects symbolic links

        Also, if the virtual file doesn't exist (as in the standalone case)
        just return zero; otherwise if the app is running standalone
        and checks the return value, it will error out.

        NOTE: apps that check the return value of boinc_resolve_filename()
        won't work on 6.12+ under Unix;
        recompiling with this change will fix the problem.

    - Unix init script: modified to make less linux specific.  
        - Does not presume the existence of "pidof" or "runuser".  
        - If started with an old style Bourne shell, will try to restart
          in bash, zsh or ksh.
    - Starts with no parameters by default.
    - Logs stdout and stderr to /var/log/boinc_client.log and
          /var/log/boinc_client_err.log by default.
    - With appropriate "boinc-client.conf", the script can be run by
      a non-root user.
    - More changes are likely to be required.
