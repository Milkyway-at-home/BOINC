    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_CONFIG
        (corresponding to the get_project_config.php web RPC):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
        - sched_stopped: scheduler disabled
        - web_stopped: DB-driven web features disabled
        - min_client_version
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to CC_STATE:
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the client
            (this replaces the unused <platform_name>)
    - GUI RPC: add the following items to PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (entry in the "all projects" list):
        - platforms: list of platforms supported by the project
    - GUI RPC: move APP_VERSION pointer from WORKUNIT to RESULT;
        include plan class in APP_VERSION lookup.
        This completes the change of March 2008,
        and allows the Manager to work correctly when a project
        has two different app versions of the same (app, platform, version)
        running on a client at once (e.g., a CPU and a GPU app)

    - STILL WORK TO BE DONE TO GET locale STUFF INSTALLED PROPERLY!!!
    - Update to libtool 1.5.24
    - build environment:  Major automake changes that I've been warning about
      for some time.
    - Now uses libtool to build libraries.
    - Builds separate boinc_fcgi and sched_fcgi libraries for use with 
      FCGI server components.
    - New macro "BOINC_CHECK_LIB_WITH" that executes a "AC_CHECK_LIB" on
      a library only if --with-libname[=DIR] is specified on the configure
      command line.  This is to allow inclusion of libraries when the 
      ssl, gtk, wxWidgets, or other configuration is incorrect for static
      libraries.
    - Added a lot of "--with-*" for some libraries that might be required for
      static builds.
    - The sea directory has been moved to packages/generic.  Changes to sea
      and the associated scripts might be required to better make use of the
      staging mechanism and shared libraries.
    - Fixed includes of boinc_fcgi.h in many files.
    - Fixed places where FCGI_FILE needs to be used implicitly.
    - Fixed missing define of _SC_PAGESIZE on hosts that define only
      _SC_PAGE_SIZE.
    - Moved build of boinc_cmd (and source file) from lib to client

    The above two changes are intended to allow the QCN app to

    - Work fetch / scheduler:
        There are two mechanisms to prevent the scheduler from
        sending jobs that won't finish by their deadline.
        Simple mechanism:
            The client sends the interval x for which CPUs are projected
            to be saturated.
            Given a job with estimated duration y,
            the scheduler doesn't send it if x + y exceeds the delay bound.
            If it does send it, x is incremented by y.
        Complex mechanism:
            Client sends workload description.
            Scheduler does EDF simulation, sees if deadlines are missed.
            The only project using this AFAIK is BOINC alpha test.
        Neither of these mechanisms takes coprocessors into account,
        and as a result jobs could be sent that are doomed to
        miss their deadline.
        This checkin adds coprocessor awareness to the Simple mechanism.

        Changes:
        Client:
            compute estimated delay (i.e. time until non-saturation)
            for coprocessors as well as CPU.
            Send them in scheduler request as part of coproc descriptor.
        Scheduler:
            Keep track of estimated delays separately for different resources
    - client: fixed bug that computed CPU estimated delay incorrectly
    - client: the work request (req_secs) for a resource is the min
        of the project's share and the shortfall.

David  31 Jan 2009
    - client: there was a problem with how the round simulator
        worked in the presence of coprocessors.
        The simulator maintained per-project queues of pending jobs.
        When a job finished (in the simulation) it would get
        one or more jobs from that project's pending queue.

        The problem: this could cause "holes" in the scheduling of GPUs,
        and produce an erroneous nonzero shortfall for GPUs,
        leading to infinite work fetch.

        The solution: maintain a separate (per-resource, not per--project)
        queue of pending coprocessor jobs.
        When a coprocessor job finishes,
        start pending jobs from the queue for that resource.

        Another change: the simulator did strict reservation of coprocessors.
        If there are 2 instances of CUDA,
        and a 1-instance job is running in the simulation,
        it wouldn't start an additional 2-instance job.
        This also can cause erroneous nonzero shortfalls.

        So instead, schedule coprocessors like CPUs, i.e. saturate them.
        This can cause distorted completion time estimates,
        but it's better than infinite work fetch.
