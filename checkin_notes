    - scheduler: add support for resource-specific scheduler requests:
        - parse new request message elements
            (CPU and coproc requested seconds and instances)
        - decide how many jobs to send based on these params
        - select app version based on these params
            (may send both CPU and CUDA app versions for the same app!)
