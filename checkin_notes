    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages
        now have community info in a 2nd column on the right.
        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.
