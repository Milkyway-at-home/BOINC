    - client: fix job scheduling bug.
        Scenario: we have 2 CPUs and 1GB RAM
        Project A has jobs that use 1GB.
        Project B has small-mem jobs.
        Currently, we ignore RAM usage in building the runnable job list,
        so we might pick 2 jobs from project A.
        enforce_schedule() (which checks RAM usage) will run just one of them,
        and the other CPU will be idle.
        Solution: keep track of RAM usage while building the runnable job list.

    - client: eliminate unnecessary CPU reschedules.
        Currently we do a reschedule any time a job checkpoints,
        in case there's a job that has finished a time slice
        but hasn't checkpointed yet.
        Instead: flag such jobs, and trigger a reschedule
        on checkpoint only for flagged jobs.
    - client: fix instability in job scheduling that happens
        if a job's estimated completion time in RR sim is close to its deadline.
        It can alternate between making and missing deadline,
        causing the scheduler to alternate rapidly between jobs.
        Solution: if RR sim has marked a job as deadline miss
        any time in the last (CPU scheduling period),
        treat it as a deadline miss.

            Some confusing and incorrect logic in the transitioner
            tries to provide the desired semantics.

        to be skipped in RR simulation,
        and therefore to not be counted in the work buffer.
        However, "download stalled" was not being evaluated correctly;

    - scheduler: fix a problem with job resend.
        When we first send a job, we pick an app version,
        then call wu_is_infeasible_fast()
        to see if the host is able to run the job with that app version.
        In addition to checking disk space etc.
        this calls wu_is_infeasible_custom() to do project-specific checks
        (e.g. for SETI@home: don't use GPUs for VLAR jobs).

        However, when we resend a job, we pick an app version
        (possibly different from the original one)
        and send the job without any checking.
        So, for example, we might send a VLAR job to a GPU,
        or send a job to a host with insufficient disk space
        (because free space has changed since original send).

        Solution: call wu_is_infeasible_fast() before resending a job,
        and if it returns true, mark the job as done and don't resend it.
