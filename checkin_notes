    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
	(platform name comes from configure)

    - Allow applications to have multiple files
        (e.g. scripts, libraries, pre- and post-processing programs).
        The app_version table now has an xml_doc field,
        which contains a list of <file_info> and <file_ref> elements.
        Note: the utility for adding applications (tools/add.C)
        still handles only single-file applications.
    - Changed IO_FILE_DESC to FILE_REF since it now represents
        an association of a file to workunit, result or application

    - Change the scheduling server to reduce database accesses.
        There's now a shared-memory segment that contains
        1) the platform, app, and app_version tables in their entirety;
        2) a fixed-size set of results ready to be sent,
            and their corresponding workunit.
        This segment is initialized and maintained by a new program
        called the "feeder" (sched/feeder.C) that should run
        whenever the scheduling server is up.
        Note: the scheduler still needs to be converted to fast CGI
    - Added handy interfaces for dealing with shared memory and semaphores.
    - Changed to utilities and scripts used for testing so that all
        server-specific names (paths and URLs) come from environment
        variables instead of being hardwired in the code.
        You'll want to add these to your .tcshrc or whatever.
        See the doc/install.html for details.

	files db/dependencies and client/config.status and client/config.log
		removed.  These are build time files and should not belong
		in the source tree.  They confuse subsequent builds.
	files updated: configure configure.in api/Makefile.in
		apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in db/Makefile.in
		db/mysql.h lib/Makefile.in sched/Makefile.in
		tools/Makefile.in

	These Makefile.in changes will allow the build to be performed
	outside the source tree.  This is convenient for several
	reasons.  The number one reason is that this allows the source
	tree to remain untouched by the build and therefore clean.
	This will prevent garbage build files from being checked in
	during a 'cvs commit'

	To run a build outside the source tree, simply make an object
	directory anywhere else that you would like to work, then just
	execute the configure script in the top-level boinc directory.
		$ mkdir boincobj
		$ cd boincobj
		$ <... path to source tree ...>/boinc/configure
		$ make > make.out 2>&1 &

	Note the examples in apps/Makefile.in and sched/Makefile.in
	of how to use the top_srcdir variable to locate include files
	in the source tree outside of the current directory.  Local
	references to other object files and libraries produced by
	the build remain as local .. references.

	The change to configure.in, (and thus configure) and db/mysql.h
	allow a proper identification of where the mysql .h files live.
	The SSL location of /usr/local/mysql/include is a bit non-standard.
	Most systems will have these in /usr/local/include/mysql

Hiram C.		Sat May 25 09:20:25 PDT 2002
	Continue updating:
	Makefile.in config.guess configure configure.in api/Makefile.in
	apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in client/config.guess
	client/configure client/configure.in sched/Makefile.in
	tools/Makefile.in

	I have almost clean builds now on Solaris, Mac OS X,
	and UnixWare.  There appears to be a missing sched_shmem.h
	file from the source tree.

	There is still cruft in this configure system.  I will continue
	to work on it to clean it up.

    - Mostly implemented support for editing preferences,
        including project-specific preferences.
        Simplified the preferences scheme.
        Abandoned the idea of multiple preference sets per user;
        each user now has a single set of preferences.
        Got rid of the "prefs" database table;
        prefs are now just an XML and mod_time field in the user table.
        Haven't tested much yet.
    
    NOTE: these new features use the XML parsing features of PHP.
    This means that, on the BOINC web server,
    you must configure PHP with the --with-xml option,
    and you must make and install Apache.
    Also, you probably need to use a recent version of PHP;
    XML parsing was broken in PHP 4.0.4, but it works in 4.2.1.

	updating: client/configure client/configure.in
	client/net_xfer.C sched/Makefile.in sched/feeder.C

	This now builds just fine on Solaris, Linux and OpenUnix8.
	And only two tiny errors remain for a Mac OS X build.
	That being the specification of g++ in the sched/Makefile
	and statvfs() is not available on the Mac for
	the client/hostinfo_unix.C compile.  Need a substitute for
	that function on the Mac.

    - Ensure that preferences propagate from the server
        where they are updated to all hosts,
        and from there to the servers of other project.
        Eliminated concept of "home project".
        Not tested yet.
        Also to do: replace the "accounts.xml" file with
        a file containing preferences.
    - Changed the way the client handles preferences.
        It now saves saves the exact XML it gets from the server,
        regardless of whether it can parse it all.
    - Fixed client parsing code to reflect new names for preferences
    - Changed the way the scheduling server handles prefs in
        a client/server interaction.
        If it gets newer prefs, it updates its own DB.
        If its DB has newer prefs, it sends them to client.
    - Fixed the test scripts so that they start/stop the feeder also.
        This required adding a "ready" flag to the shared-mem structure
        so that the scheduling server can find out if the feeder hasn't
        finished initializing the structure.
        Also required adding a "-synch" cmdline option to feeder.
    - added utility program (sched/show_shmem.C) for looking at
        scheduler shared memory
    - renamed "types.*" to "client_types.*" to avoid name conflict
        with system include files
