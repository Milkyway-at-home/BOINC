    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages
        now have community info in a 2nd column on the right.
        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.

        using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.

        using launchd, use launchctl to launch newly installed Client as 
        a daemon.

    - Mac MGR: if using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism to run Client as a daemon,
        allow time for daemon to launch.  
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        uses Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  This requires BOINC version 
        5.10.34 or later and Mac OS 10.4 or later.

    - API: call update_app_progress() only from the timer thread.
        Previously it was called from both timer and worker thread,
        with no synchronization.  Bad.
        boinc_finish(): sleep for 2 seconds, enough to ensure that
        the timer thread sends the final messages.
    - API: a compile flag GETRUSAGE_IN_TIMER_THREAD selects
        how to get CPU time; by default set only for Mac OS X
    - scheduler: cap #CPUs scaling for <max_wus_per_host> at 8

    - API, Unix: fix bug where boinc_sleep() hangs forever.
        This was because SIGALRM always interrupts sleep()
        and keeps boinc_sleep() stuck in its while loop.
        Solution: change boinc_sleep() so that it works even if
        rapid signals (e.g. interval timer) are happening
