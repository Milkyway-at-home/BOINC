	- core client: if an app fails to start,
		it could be that the executable has been munged.
		So verify the files; this will find the bad file
		and download it again.
	- Manager: in Attach to Account Manager wizard, add some text saying
		if they want to just attach to a single project,
		use the Attach to Project wizard instead.
		Some users tried to attach SETI@home using the acct mgr wizard
		and got all bent outta shape when it didn't work.

    - Win SETUP: Add custom actions for saving and restoring user preferences
        to the registry
    - Win SETUP: MoveFileEx isn't spported on the Win9x platform, so dynamically
        load and execute it on Windows 2000 or better.
    - Win SETUP: Remove some dead code from the custom action list.
    - Win SETUP: On Windows XP systems or better, we no longer require the
       service account to have a password, Microsoft has taken care of the
       problem by not allowing incomming network connections for accounts with
       no passwords.

    - Win SETUP: Fix an issue when restoring saved properties where junk was
        being introduced into properties where no value was defined.
    - Win SETUP: Don't attemp to restore any properties until we have actually
        stored some from a previous iteration of setup, otherwise our defaults
        don't kick in.
    - Win SETUP: Saving and Restoring properties is now only enabled for those
        using the UI deployment method, we don't want to throw anything
        in the registry when the MSI package is being deployed through AD or
        some other deployment mechinism.
