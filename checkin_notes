    - Tag for 5.3.7 release, all platforms
      boinc_core_release_5_3_7

    - replace safe_strncpy() with strlcpy() everywhere.
        Same semantics, but the former is less efficient.
    - simplified Bruce's recent fix to escape_string()

    - scheduler: scan_work_array(): if add_result_to_reply() fails, do NOT
        reinsert the entry in the array by resetting the "present" flag.
        We previously cleared this flag,
        so the array entry may have been refilled by the feeder,
        and it might be in the CHECKED_OUT state.
