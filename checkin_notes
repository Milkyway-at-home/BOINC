    - VBOX: If VirtualBox reports an error snag both the hypervisor system
        log as well as the VM execution log.  Maybe the hypervisor log
        will tell us what is up with the virtual floppy device.
    - VBOX: Don't retry commands that are expected to fail in normal use
        cases.  It slows down getting the VM up and running.
    - VBOX: After starting the VM, use a timed loop waiting for the initial
        VM state change instead of just waiting for 5 seconds.  Older
        machines can take longer than 5 seconds to switch from poweroff
        to starting.  If we hit the main poll loop in that state the wrapper
        thinks we have crashed.
    - VBOX: Strip carriage returns from all the vboxmanage output on
        Windows.

        Report it (along with disk usage) in scheduler request messages.
        This will allow the scheduler to send file-delete commands
        if the project is using more than its share.

    - VBOX: Per tester feedback, at an hourly status report to track
        network usage.
    - VBOX: For errors where an error code is specified in the output,
        use that value when returning from vbm_open().  Make it easier
        to track failure rates by problem type in the ops pages.
        (Windows Only)
    - VBOX: Try making the process of extracting the hypervisor system
        log more robust, make a temp copy of it in the slot directory.
        Avoid exclusive file lock issues since VboxSvc will still be
        logging to it.
    - VBOX: Change the session lock text to make it clearer that the
        use of other VirtualBox management tools can cause a problem.

        report_net_usage.
    - VBOX: Only report network usage in the status report if
        aid.global_prefs.daily_xfer_limit_mb is non-zero
    - VBOX: Add the VM log to the list of things reported on a start
        failure.  Hypervisor log suggests that it launched the VM but
        it failed unexpectedly.  So there might be cases where it
        actually exists.

    - VBOX: Move start state change detection code from run() function to
        start() function and use similar code to handle stop as well.
        
        Weird stuff happens when people start/stop BOINC quickly,
        it looks as though the previous VM instance isn't shutdown before we
        attempt to start it again.  Hopefully enough of a wait is in there
        for the VM to fully halt before the wrapper is terminated.

    - VBOX: Fix a crash bug if multiple virtual NICs are defined for a VM.
        I'm not sure what the heck happened.  It probably has something to

        I suppose.
