    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
	(platform name comes from configure)

    - Think through application-version logic.  Here's how it works:
	On the server side, WUs don't have a version number,
	either in the DB or in the XML doc.
	When the server sends a WU,
	it precedes it with an <app> tag containing a version number.
	This instructs the client to process all WUs included in
	the reply using that app version.
	On the client side, WU records DO have a version number
	(obtained as above).
    - Change the "add" program so that command-line arguments are named
	(e.g., "-app_name" foo instead of just "foo")
	Modify test scripts accordingly.
    - Have the scheduler read static tables (platform, app, app_version)
	into memory at the beginning (new class: DB_CACHE)
	This is a first step towards making the server efficient
	(also need to convert it to fast CGI)
    - Have the scheduler use files of the form
	/tmp/boinc_req_PID and /tmp/boinc_reply_PID
	rather than fixed-named files
    - Have the scheduler send back error message when it can't open files
