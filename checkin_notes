    - VBOX: If VirtualBox reports an error snag both the hypervisor system
        log as well as the VM execution log.  Maybe the hypervisor log
        will tell us what is up with the virtual floppy device.
    - VBOX: Don't retry commands that are expected to fail in normal use
        cases.  It slows down getting the VM up and running.
    - VBOX: After starting the VM, use a timed loop waiting for the initial
        VM state change instead of just waiting for 5 seconds.  Older
        machines can take longer than 5 seconds to switch from poweroff
        to starting.  If we hit the main poll loop in that state the wrapper
        thinks we have crashed.
    - VBOX: Strip carriage returns from all the vboxmanage output on
        Windows.

        use that value when returning from vbm_open().  Make it easier
        to track failure rates by problem type in the ops pages.

    - VBOX: Try making the process of extracting the hypervisor system
        log more robust, make a temp copy of it in the slot directory.
        Avoid exclusive file lock issues since VboxSvc will still be
        logging to it.

        it failed unexpectedly.  So there might be cases where it
        actually exists.

        Weird stuff happens when people start/stop BOINC quickly,
        it looks as though the previous VM instance isn't shutdown before we
        attempt to start it again.  Hopefully enough of a wait is in there
        for the VM to fully halt before the wrapper is terminated.
