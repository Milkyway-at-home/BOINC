    - Server: change the usage of host.credit_per_cpu_sec
        so that it is the recent average of granted credit per CPU sec,
        as computed by Bruce's update_credit_per_cpu_sec() function
        (finally, a use for hyperbolic trig functions in BOINC).
        Prior to this it was the most recent value of
        claimed credit per CPU sec, which is not as useful.
        Add a new non-DB member to HOST, claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        for this purpose.
    - db_dump.C: export host.credit_per_cpu_sec
    - move update_credit_per_cpu_sec() from lib/util.C to sched/validate_util.C

    Once a few projects pick up this change, it will be useful
    for comparing credit-granting policies between projects
    (for hosts that participate in multiple projects,
    the credit per CPU second should be about the same).
