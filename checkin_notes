    Initial checkin of all files.
    The system is fairly feature-complete and
    runs a number of test cases correctly.
    Currently runs only on Linux.

    - Got things to compile on Solaris.
    - Pass in platform name, version number from Makefile
	(platform name comes from configure)

David A.        May 15 2002
    - Allow applications to have multiple files
        (e.g. scripts, libraries, pre- and post-processing programs).
        The app_version table now has an xml_doc field,
        which contains a list of <file_info> and <file_ref> elements.
        Note: the utility for adding applications (tools/add.C)
        still handles only single-file applications.
    - Changed IO_FILE_DESC to FILE_REF since it now represents
        an association of a file to workunit, result or application

    - Change the scheduling server to reduce database accesses.
        There's now a shared-memory segment that contains
        1) the platform, app, and app_version tables in their entirety;
        2) a fixed-size set of results ready to be sent,
            and their corresponding workunit.
        This segment is initialized and maintained by a new program
        called the "feeder" (sched/feeder.C) that should run
        whenever the scheduling server is up.
        Note: the scheduler still needs to be converted to fast CGI
    - Added handy interfaces for dealing with shared memory and semaphores.
    - Changed to utilities and scripts used for testing so that all
        server-specific names (paths and URLs) come from environment
        variables instead of being hardwired in the code.
        You'll want to add these to your .tcshrc or whatever.
        See the doc/install.html for details.

	files db/dependencies and client/config.status and client/config.log
		removed.  These are build time files and should not belong
		in the source tree.  They confuse subsequent builds.
	files updated: configure configure.in api/Makefile.in
		apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in db/Makefile.in
		db/mysql.h lib/Makefile.in sched/Makefile.in
		tools/Makefile.in

	These Makefile.in changes will allow the build to be performed
	outside the source tree.  This is convenient for several
	reasons.  The number one reason is that this allows the source
	tree to remain untouched by the build and therefore clean.
	This will prevent garbage build files from being checked in
	during a 'cvs commit'

	To run a build outside the source tree, simply make an object
	directory anywhere else that you would like to work, then just
	execute the configure script in the top-level boinc directory.
		$ mkdir boincobj
		$ cd boincobj
		$ <... path to source tree ...>/boinc/configure
		$ make > make.out 2>&1 &

	Note the examples in apps/Makefile.in and sched/Makefile.in
	of how to use the top_srcdir variable to locate include files
	in the source tree outside of the current directory.  Local
	references to other object files and libraries produced by
	the build remain as local .. references.

	The change to configure.in, (and thus configure) and db/mysql.h
	allow a proper identification of where the mysql .h files live.
	The SSL location of /usr/local/mysql/include is a bit non-standard.
	Most systems will have these in /usr/local/include/mysql

	Continue updating:
	Makefile.in config.guess configure configure.in api/Makefile.in
	apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in client/config.guess
	client/configure client/configure.in sched/Makefile.in
	tools/Makefile.in

	I have almost clean builds now on Solaris, Mac OS X,
	and UnixWare.  There appears to be a missing sched_shmem.h
	file from the source tree.

	There is still cruft in this configure system.  I will continue
	to work on it to clean it up.

    - Mostly implemented support for editing preferences,
        including project-specific preferences.
        Simplified the preferences scheme.
        Abandoned the idea of multiple preference sets per user;
        each user now has a single set of preferences.
        Got rid of the "prefs" database table;
        prefs are now just an XML and mod_time field in the user table.
        Haven't tested much yet.
    
    NOTE: these new features use the XML parsing features of PHP.
    This means that, on the BOINC web server,
    you must configure PHP with the --with-xml option,
    and you must make and install Apache.
    Also, you probably need to use a recent version of PHP;
    XML parsing was broken in PHP 4.0.4, but it works in 4.2.1.

	updating: client/configure client/configure.in
	client/net_xfer.C sched/Makefile.in sched/feeder.C

	This now builds just fine on Solaris, Linux and OpenUnix8.
	And only two tiny errors remain for a Mac OS X build.
	That being the specification of g++ in the sched/Makefile
	and statvfs() is not available on the Mac for
	the client/hostinfo_unix.C compile.  Need a substitute for
	that function on the Mac.

    - Ensure that preferences propagate from the server
        where they are updated to all hosts,
        and from there to the servers of other project.
        Eliminated concept of "home project".
        Not tested yet.
        Also to do: replace the "accounts.xml" file with
        a file containing preferences.
    - Changed the way the client handles preferences.
        It now saves saves the exact XML it gets from the server,
        regardless of whether it can parse it all.
    - Fixed client parsing code to reflect new names for preferences
    - Changed the way the scheduling server handles prefs in
        a client/server interaction.
        If it gets newer prefs, it updates its own DB.
        If its DB has newer prefs, it sends them to client.
    - Fixed the test scripts so that they start/stop the feeder also.
        This required adding a "ready" flag to the shared-mem structure
        so that the scheduling server can find out if the feeder hasn't
        finished initializing the structure.
        Also required adding a "-synch" cmdline option to feeder.
    - added utility program (sched/show_shmem.C) for looking at
        scheduler shared memory
    - renamed "types.*" to "client_types.*" to avoid name conflict
        with system include files

David A     June 9 2002
    - added support for multiple URLs in a FILE_INFO
        (e.g. multiple servers from which the file can be downloaded)
    - started work on "persistent file transfer": a layer on top of
        FILE_XFER that manages restarting from failed connections,
        and that implements a give-up policy
    - added offset arguments to GET and PUT HTTP operations.
        NOTE: this will work fine for downloading files (GET)
        but we'll have to use something else for upload,
        since the standard PUT handler doesn't do offsets,
        and we need security functionality in any case.
    - added preliminary version of application API for
        communicating with core client.
    - use <file_ref> tags instead of <input_file> and <output_file>
        (makes things simpler)

    - Replaced the "accounts.xml" file with the user preferences ("prefs.xml").
        All non-host-specific project info is stored in this file;
        all host-specific project info is in client_state.xml.
        The PROJECT class is a union of the two.
        The logic for dealing with inconsistencies between
        prefs.xml and client_state.xml, and with updating in-memory
        and on-disk project lists in response to an update from a server,
        are a little tricky and are described in the code.
    - The prefs file can be overwritten by <preferences> in a scheduling
        server reply.  To prevent buggy servers from zeroing out
        users' project lists, the client makes sure there's at least
        one project, and backs up the old prefs.xml into a timestamped file.
    - The command-line client, if prefs.xml is absent,
        prompts the user for a project URL and authenticator,
        and creates an initial prefs.xml.
    - Each project now has a "master URL", with is its home page
        and also contains <scheduler> elements giving the URLs of
        its scheduling servers.
    - Added a class SCHEDULER_OP which encapsulates fetching and
        parsing a project's master page (if necessary),
        then making an RPC to one of its scheduling servers.
        TODO: add retry and failure logic.
    - A project can have more than one scheduling server.
        TODO: use all of them.
    - Project directories are stored in URL-encoded form.
        This allows project master URLs to have slashes, which is a necessity.

David Anderson      July 4, 2002
    - Added support for upload authentication.
        This prevents bad guys from filling up data servers with trash.
        In this scheme, each <file_info> element sent from
        server to client includes a <max_nbytes> field limiting
        the size of the file, and includes a digital signature
        based on the project's "upload authentication" key pair.
        File uploads, instead of being done by PUT, are now done by POST 
        to a CGI program, "file_upload_handler".
        The request header includes the signed <file_info>,
        and the CGI program verifies the signature and enforces the size limit.

        The affected pieces of code:
        - Added a function create_keys() in PHP test scripts
            to create encryption keys.  Call it from all script.
        - Added environment var BOINC_KEY_DIR saying where keys are kept.
        - The client must maintain an exact copy of each <file_info> XML,
            and of the signature, so that it can send to upload server.
        - Added a new variant of HTTP operation, HTTP_OP_POST2.
            The existing variants all use single files for request and reply.
            The new variant (used for file upload) has a request
            consisting of a memory block followed by (part of) a file;
            the reply is in memory.
            This avoid copying possibly huge upload files.
        - FILE_XFER objects now take a FILE_INFO as initialization argument;
            needed to convey authentication info.
            The upload variant creates and sends the authentication header.
        - Result templates now include a <max_nbytes> in each
            <file_info> element, and the URLs refer to the
            file_upload_handler (with no filename)
        - process_result_template() works differently, since it must
            generate a digital signature at the end of each <file_info>
        - create_work expects the name of a private key file.
        - Added crypt/md5 functions to sign/verify in memory,
            encode/decode ASCII data in memory, checksum in memory
    - Change "gmake" to "make" in top-level makefile.
        (alias make to gmake if this is a problem)

David A.    July 7, 2002
    - Added code signing.  All files associated with an app version
        (i.e. all executable files) must now be signed
        with the project's "code sign key".  The components include:
        - PROJECT has new field "code_sign_key", keep track of project's
            public code-signing key.
            Send this on each scheduler RPC.
        - The scheduling server stores the public code-signing key in memory.
            Send it to any client who doesn't have it.
            If the client has an old key,
            send them the new key signed with the old key.
            NOTE: this uses a scheme in which signatures are kept
            in files on the server, to avoid keeping private keys
            in online machines.  This should be documented.
        - The utility to add new app versions (add.C) adds a signature
            to the FILE_INFO element.
            NOTE: eventually the signing should be done offline.
        - FILE_INFO has a new boolean field "signature_required";
            set for all files associated with an app version
        - FILE_INFO has a new char* field "file_signature",
            which is the digital signature.
            Renamed upload authenticator from "signature" to "xml_signature"
            to avoid confusion.
        - Add function verify_downloaded_file(), called after every download;
            does MD5 or signature checking as needed.
        - Added some new functions for signature checking etc.
        - the client is now linked with the crypt library
    - Server-side errors should always include the name of the
        CGI program generating the error (scheduler or file upload handler)

David A     July 14 2002
    - Added reasonable policies for making scheduler RPCs.  Summary:
        - results now have a "report deadline".
            This may be useful for various purposes; for now,
            we use it to trigger scheduler RPCs to report results
        - The client now tries all a project's scheduler URLs in turn.
        - Projects have a "min_rpc_time", the earliest time to
            attempt another RPC (replaces next_request_time)
        - We maintain an RPC failure count for each project.
            If RPCs to all its URLs fail, we increment the count
            and set its min_rpc_time according to an exponential backoff
        - If a project is getting repeated RPC failures,
            reread and parse its master URL file every so often,
            in case the set of scheduler URLs has changed
        - When the client has a completed result past its deadline,
            it attempts to report it to that project.
        - When the client's estimated work falls below low water,
            it ranks projects according to their "resource deficit",
            then attempts RPCs to project in that order
            until the estimated work is above high water.
        NOTE: only the simplest case has been tested.
        We need to write test scripts for many other cases.
        NOTE: currently a result's report deadline is now+1000.
        We need to add a mechanism for setting it.
    - The CLIENT_STATE is now kept in a global variable instead of
        a local var of main().
        This is because SCHEDULER_OP needs to get at it.

    - Removed assembly optimized routines from RSAEuro, since we
      want to be platform independent and RSAEuro isn't a highly speed
      critical piece of code.  This had the side benefit of making the
      RSAEuro Makefile operate cleanly with make.
    - Fixed compiler warnings in RSAEuro demo programs.  Do we really
      need to keep these demo programs around?
    - Turned off the "secure" versions of memcpy, memset and memcmp.
      If needed, we can turn them back on.

David   July 28 2002
    - Changed the "add" utility so that, when adding an app version,
        you can give it the signature files (computed offline, presumably)
    - Changed the "add" utility so that an app version can consist
        of multiple files
    - Removed the notion of alpha/beta/production versions of an app.
        The same effect can be achieved by making separate projects
        for alpha and beta testing.
    - Apps now have a "minimum version number" on the server side -
        Don't send a WU unless there's an app version of that number or greater.
        Send the latest available version for the platform.
    - Clarified app version semantics:
        - Workunits don't have a version# on the server
        - When a client gets a workunit, it associates it with
            the most recent version of the application that it knows about
            (possibly one it received in the same reply message).
            It continues to use this version for this WU,
            even if it receives a later version while the WU is in progress.
        - On the client, no version #s are associated with apps
    
    PROGRAMMERS NOTE:
    - Removed checking of args in client_state.C
        This gunks up the code too much.  Let's do checking at higher level.
    - Comments should be in the imperative mood.
        "Write the state file", not "Writes the state file"
    - Comments should not be vague, e.g.
        // See if the application (name) associated with project p is
        // around here
        ... what does "around here" mean?
    - Leave a space between "if" and "("
    - When asserting that a pointer is non-NULL, just say "assert(p)".
        Saying "assert(p!=NULL)" is like saying if (flag==true)
    - Linux doesn't have -lsocket and -lnsl.
        Don't put them in Makefile.in.

    Various changes to API:
        - Added user, team names, credit info to APP_INIT_DATA
        - separate call for getting init data
        - separate call for returning fraction done
        - separated out fraction_done_update_period
        - moved graphics API to separate file
        - moved MFILE implementation to separate file
        - API timer is now 0.1 sec; use counters for various uses
            (checkpoint, fraction done, graphics)
        - changed name of API files to boinc_api.C,h

    - clarify distinction between
        "current CPU time"
        "CPU time at last checkpoint"
        "CPU time at start of current run"
        These are all kept in ACTIVE_TASK.
        RESULT now only has "final CPU time".
    
    - fixed bug in dir scanning (ahem...)
    
    - Coding style notes:
        - every fopen() MUST have a matching fclose() in same function
        - every malloc() MUST have a matching free() in same function
        - don't do a rewind() right after fopen()
        - write function calls as
            func(arg1, arg2);
            NOTE: there's a space after every comma, everywhere
        - write "if" statements as
            if (condition) {
                ...
            }
        - no explicit argument checking.  do this at higher level
        - functions in foo.C should be declared (as extern) in foo.h,
            AND NOWHERE ELSE.

    - Added concept of result state.  This replaces the old boolean
      flags and represents what phase of the computation pipeline
      each result is currently at (downloading, computing, uploading,
      etc).
    - Added file upload/download resumption.  For downloads, this
      involves checking how big the local file is, then asking
      the server for the remainder of it.  For uploads, this
      involves asking the file_upload_handler how much of a certain
      file it already has, then sending the remainder of it.
      Both ul and dl resumption need to be thoroughly tested.

    - return user name, total credit, avg credit in scheduler RPC reply
	- save/restore these in client state file
    - client was trying to delete "checkpoint CPU file" in wrong directory
    - change CLIENT_STATE field from "version" to "core_client_version"

	(made some stuff public)
    - disable host performance measurement (temp! turn back on later)
    - removed comments of the form
	read_config_file();    // read config file
    - in HTTP op of type POST2, it's not an error if htp->file is zero
    - replaced hardwired HTTP_STATUS constants

	define it separately here.

    - Move account into (master URL, authenticator, per-project prefs)
        from the prefs.xml file into separate files, one per project
        (with names of the form account_XXX.xml, XXX = master URL).
        Adding new projects is now done using the core client
        (via GUI or command line) or by copying an existing account file,
        but NOT via web site; this was a major security weakness
        since bad guys could guess your web password,
        then register you for a bogus project.

        This change also involved the html_user files (not finished).
    
    - Further work on credit-granting.
        On each RPC, the scheduler computes a "credit per CPU second"
        for the host (linear combo of FP/int/mem speeds).
        For each result received, the scheduler computes a "claimed credit",
        the claimed CPU time times the credit per CPU second.
        It also sets the "need validate" flag of the WU.

    - Clarified the way that preferences (global and project)
        are stored in the database and in the core client,
        and the protocol (part of scheduler RPC) for maintaining them.
        See doc/prefs_impl.html
    - Implemented the above: lots of small changes to client, server
    - Changed names from "prefs" to "global_prefs" where relevant

    - Changed the PHP framework for testing to facilitate
        multi-project, multi-host tests (all on one machine).
        See doc/test.html for details.
    - NOTE: the BOINC-related environment variables have changed.
        There are no longer any project-specific variables
        (e.g. database name, shmem key)
    - NOTE: the server programs now expect a configuration file
        in their directory.
    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow projects with
        multiple scheduling servers or data servers
    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow specification
        of failure and recovery of servers
    
    - changed things so a NULL in the DB won't crash db_mysql.C
    - parse_int() can now handle hex
    - "add" now takes args for DB name/passwd
    - "create_work" now takes args for DB name/passwd,
        upload/download URL, download dir

David   Oct 3 2002
    - updated test scripts to use new framework
    - got rid of some obsolete scripts

David   Oct 8 2002
    - progress getting "make_work" (dummy work generator) to work.
        Removed the <name> element from workunit XML,
        and the <name> and <wu_name> elements from result XML;
        instead, the scheduler server inserts these as it sends them.

        This simplifies things a little in work generation,
        and removes some redundancy.

        Everything seems to work now except that the file upload signature
        ends up being wrong, which is expected,
        and it shows that the security mechanism works.
    - added test_loop.php, which simulates a system that is complete
        except for the validation process.

David  Oct 14 2002
    - Change make_work so that it generates results with
        valid file upload signatures.
        Instead of directly creating new DB.result records,
        it now calls create_result() to do the work.
    - Changed create_result() to take a name suffix
    - Factored key parsing into a function
    - Removed random-WU-name feature from create_work;
        names should be generated at a higher level
    - added a key-generation function to test.inc

    - remove the idea of "dynamic result" generation
        (remove some DB fields and code relating to it)
    - remove the nresults_* fields from the workunit table.
        These are redundant, and they weren't being used.
        Furthermore, they were being updated in a way that
        overwrote other updates.

    - floating-point values are passed to/from MySQL using sprintf and atof.
        The "%f" format, by default, uses 6 decimal places of precision.
        This is inadequate for small values, e.g. 1e-7.
        So db_mysql.C should use %.12e instead of %f.
    - changed all floats to doubles in DB schema

    - fixed bug that caused file upload authentication failure
    - The user web site now correctly provides download of the core client,
        as long as you add a core client app version in your test script
        (see test_uc.php for an example)
    - version numbers now come from env vars BOINC_MAJOR_VERSION
        and BOINC_MINOR_VERSION.  You must set these in your .cshrc
    - Web server config file must have
        DefaultType application/octet-stream
        so that core client is saved as file, not displayed
    - replaced "db_name" file in html_user, html_ops directories with
        "config.xml", which contains download URL as well as DB name/passwd

    - Change the file upload handler protocol a little:
        1) add core client version to request
        2) add enclosing <data_server_request> element
    - The file upload handler returns an error if client has wrong version
    - Split up long function in file_upload_handler.C

    - added initial support for aborting runaway applications:
        check for exceeding maximum CPU time or disk usage
    - create_work now takes max_cobblestones and max_disk_usage
    - split ACTIVE_TASK::suspend into separate suspend, resume functions

    A bunch of coding style notes:
    - changed ACTIVE_TASK::request_exit() so that it doesn't sleep.
        ==> The core client should never sleep <==
        This would cause a period of non-response in the GUI client
    - changed file_delete() so that it doesn't sleep or retry.
        Should eventually add garbage-collection mechanism
    - Most functions NEED to be implemented in the client.
        So e.g. instead of
        #if HAVE_SIGNAL_H
            unix code
        #endif
        #ifdef _WIN32
            win code
        #endif
        we should have
        #ifdef _WIN32
            win code
        #else
            unix code
        #endif
        Any compilation that doesn't match anything should cause a
        compile-time error
    - change file_size(), dir_size(), CLIENT_STATE::total_disk_usage() etc.
        so that:
        1) they report file size in double, not int
        2) they return an error code, not a size overloaded with error code;
            size is return in reference param
    - All fopen()s should check for zero pointer and return ERR_FOPEN
    - Omit "this->" wherever it appears

    - added field client_state to result

    - added some more functionality to repor_project_error()
      It now adds the following info to stderr_out of the result:

      <message>message if any passed</mesage>
      <active_task_state>%d</active_task_state>
      <exit_status>%d</exit_status>
      <signal>%d</signal>
      if download had failures
	 "<download_error>\
          "    <file_name>%s</file_name>
          "    <error_code>%d</error_code>\n"
	  "    </download_error>\n"
	
      
      if upload  had failures
	same as above

      if coudln't start active task for result (in which err_num should be set)
	"<couldnt_start>%d</couldnt_start>\n"
	

    - The error mechanism right now is such that any failures
    regarding file_infos (download, upload or whatever)
    are recorded in the status of the file_infos and then garbage collect
    called report_project_error.
    However errors regarding starting and ending active tasks
    are reported from app.C and cs_apps.C.

    - Have process_wu_template() fill in the file size as well as the MD5.
        This necessitated changing the format of WU templates,
        and the way they are processed.
    
    NOTE: this breaks the multiple-data-server test.
    Need to figure out another way to do that.

    -Edited make_work.C, now when a new work_unit is created,
        it's input files are copied along with it,
        with some random numbers added to the end,
        so for each new work_unit there are a set of associated new input files

    -fixed a little bug in file_deleter

    -note: strtok() changes the original string passed to it, kind of dangerous to use
 
    -from parse.h : replace_element() is now in use ( I used it for make_work.C)

        TODO: add other data sources
    - added "country" field to team
    - expanded team description from 256 chars to blob
    - turned off debug output from file upload handler, scheduler

    NOTE: there must be an index for each field or combination of fields
        that we do a "select" on!!

David  Jan 6 2003
    - change all server programs to do logging the same way:
        - all log entries written to stderr
        - write date/time at start of log entries
        - don't include program or user name in log entries
    - client: when get no work from project,
        don't back off if we're in exit_when_idle mode
    - added ob_end_flush() call in test.inc so that PHP test scripts
        have unbuffered output
    - added other backend phases (validate, file_delete) to test_loop.php
    - PROGRAMMER NOTES:
        - don't use tab chars in files
        - split long comments into separate lines
        - "extern" should never appear in a .C file
        - Don't use member function names that conflict with global functions
            (e.g. CLIENT_STATE::exit(); use cleanup_and_exit() instead)

    - Split off dummy assimilation function from the main program.
    - Added new stripchart scripts for logging DB counts
        and directory sizes

    NOTE: it looks like shared memory segment is at same address
    in feeder and cgi.  So it's OK to use pointers in it.

        A new program "start_servers" reads config.xml and starts servers.

    - added "opaque" fields to result and workunit tables.
        (allows projects to cross-reference to their science DB)
    - added "venue" field to host (home/school/work)
        This has two goals:
        1) provides a basis for multiple preference sets
            (one each for home/school/work)
        2) provides another account breakdown for stats
    - added "venue" field to user
        This is the default venue, for newly created hosts
    - simplified preferences:
        For account setup, all preferences are now on one form
        (different forms for new/return users)
        For preference editing, preferences are now in two groups
            - project preferences, including resource share,
                venue, and per-project prefs
            - global prefs (called "BOINC prefs" in user interface)
    - fixed bug where user/host credits in client state file were giant numbers

    - Added scheme for verified user update of email address
        When user updates email address, their email address in the DB
        is set to a "munged" form that includes a random string,
        and an email is sent to the new address that includes a
        URL that they must visit to verify the change.
    - The same mechanism is used on account creation;
        the email DB field is initially set to a munged form.
        This prevents hackers from adding entries to the DB
        with other peoples' email addresses.
    - Separate logic for update email address from update other user info;
        remove combinatorial logic (?) for update other user info

    - changed windows graphics handling.

        it to draw on the window.

    - Implemented network throughput limits, part of global prefs.
        There are separate limits for upload and download.
        Implementation: the NET_XFER_SET objects now has fields for
        1) the max # bytes/sec up and down (from global prefs)
        2) the limit on bytes that can be xferred this second
            Can go negative.  If it's negative, don't include
            sockets in select().
            Replenish every second.
        This replaces an implementation that didn't work
    - Reimplemented the way network throughput is measured.
        The old way measured throughput for each file xfer, and kept an average.
        This doesn't work with multiple simultaneous xfers.
        The new way uses a NET_STATS::poll() function.
        If there has been an active file xfer during the last poll period
        (new logic in NET_XFER_SET lets you find this out)
        then you add the duration of the polling period,
        and the number of bytes transferred.
        The reported throughput is averaged with throughput
        from previous sessions of the core client.
    - Increased file xfer blocksize from 4KB to 16KB
    - Got rid of dynamic buffer allocation in NET_XFER
    - Renamed "water days" to "work buf days" everywhere
    NOTE:
        clock() measure calling process CPU time, not time of day.
        Use time(0) if you want time of day.

    - added PHP code for creating/editing/deleting multiple pref sets
        See "prefs.inc" for a description of the XML format.
        Prefs are divided into two subsets (global and project).
        For each subset there is a mandatory "primary" version
        and optional versions for home, school, and work.
        The prefs display/editing code has been consolidated
        and parameterized (subset = global or project,
        venue = none, home, school, work).
        This actually simplifies things a little.

    - use venue-specific prefs on client side:
        - schedule server passes <host_venue> element in scheduler reply
            (but only when it passes back new global prefs)
        - when parsing global prefs, if find a matching
            <venue> element, parse its contents and ignore all else
        - when passing project-specific prefs to app,
            look for matching <venue> element
    - changed XML syntax of venue-specific prefs: instead of
        <home>...</home>, e.g., use
        <venue name="home">...</venue>
    - added safe_strncpy(): always adds zero byte at end.

    - Changed app->client communication to use shared memory rather
      than files.  The client sets up a shared memory segment when
      starting the app. The app attaches to it and writes XML tags
      into a 4K text buffer every second.
    - The shared memory communication has been tested by hand under
      Windows and UNIX (Mac OS X).  We should write test scripts for
      it to make sure.

        if they're empty strings

        Results are sent in random order, making it hard for hackers

    - user-visible messages about files give names, not URLs
    - Changed all occurrences of "time test" and "speed test"
        to "CPU benchmark".
        Please use accurate, consistent terminology in the code.

Erik  May 6 2003
    - Added a notion of "transient" and "permanent" errors on file uploads.
        A permanent error is returned by the file upload handler if
            - the request is malformed
            - filename includes ".."
            - the signature is bad
            - the file size is larger than allowed
        PERS_FILE_XFER checks for this return from FILE_XFER
        and gives up immediately.
    - FILE_XFER now always parses the server response (not just for file size)
    - Added some missing error checks to FILE_XFER
    - Punted on the timezone-related ifdefs:
        added hardwired ifdefs for linux and unix.
        Need to revisit this
    - in PHP test library, add a provision for multiple files per application

    - Added a new class SS_LOGIC that encapsulates the core client's
        screensaver-related logic.
        It tries to get graphics-capable apps to provide graphics,
        and if necessary it draws logo-based graphics or blanks the screen.
    - Changed ACTIVE_TASK.app_client_shm from a pointer to an object.
        NOTE: AVOID DYNAMIC ALLOCATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE

Erik  May 13 2003
    - Added a notion of "tentative" project.
        This means that the (URL, account ID) pair hasn't been verified,
        i.e. we haven't fetched the master page, found a scheduler,
        and done a scheduler op that verified the account ID.
        If anything fails for a tentative project, call project_add_failed().
        in the cmdline version this prints an error message,
        deletes all evidence of the project, and exits.
        TODO: implement for GUI
    - Make write_account_file() into a member function of PROJECT.
    - Got rid of CLIENT_STATE::change_project().
        The user must detach and attach.
    - CLIENT_STATE::quit_project() now takes a PROJECT*, not an int.
        Need to change the GUI code.
    - got rid of separate WIN_32 implementations of
        make_project_dir(), remove_project_dir(), make_slot_dir().
        THIS IS THE WRONG LEVEL FOR PLATFORM-DEPENDENT CODE!
        Instead, added boinc_mkdir() and boinc_rmdir()
    - added implementation docs for screensaver logic
    - test_uc.php: wait for a second before running client.
        On fast computers the client runs before feeder has seeded shmem.

        net_xfer.C

Erik  May 16 2003
    - set FILE_INFO::upload_offset to -1 before restarting file upload.
        This forces file size check, so that upload can resume
        with nonzero offset.
        NOTE: THE USE OF "SPECIAL VALUES" (LIKE -1) IS DISCOURAGED
    - don't set RESULT::state to NEW after parse.
        This caused completed results to start over.
    - PERS_FILE_XFER::start_xfer() is int, not bool
    - better messages on file transfer failure and project backoff
    - better message from scheduler if wrong major version
    - file upload handler logging is on by default
