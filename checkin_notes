    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages

        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Client: add <run_apps_manually> config flag.
        This is for debugging apps (currently works only in Unix).
        What it does: when running an app,
        the client does everything except actually fork/exec the app,
        i.e. it sets up the slot dir, creates shared mem segment etc.
        It then continues as if the app were actually running,
        and you can then manually run your app under a debugger
        in the slot directory.
        Note: the client won't notice the termination of your app.
    - API, Unix: in situations where the timer thread wants to exit
        (e.g. it notices a missing heartbeat).
        don't directly call boinc_exit(),
        since this touches data structures that the worker thread
        may be using concurrently.
        Instead, set a flag telling the worker thread to call boinc_exit()
        (which it will do from its signal handler)
        This is an attempt to fix problems reported by Bernd;
        I haven't tested it.

        It didn't work on a host's first scheduler RPC

        How do we look up user in this case?
        The weak auth is not stored explicitly in the DB.

    - client: a project (Ralph) had accidentally included a .svn directory in a zip archive,
        resulting in a lot of read-only files in its slot directories.
        When the client attempts to delete these files,
        each delete fails and the client retries for about 5 seconds.
        This adds up to a delay of about 20 minutes,
        during which the client (and Manager) appear to be hung.

        Solution:
        1) if a file delete fails with error ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED,
            use SetFileAttributes() to clear the read-only flag, then try again.
        2) Don't use the 5-second retry mechanism when clearing out
            slot directories.  These can contain unbounded numbers of files,
            and this can lead to long periods where the client appears hung.

    - web: fixed screwed-up UOTD logic.
        The meaning of the <screen_profiles> config flag is:
        If set:
            profiles must be screened by admins before their photo is shown.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
            (and they become eligible to be UOTD)
        If not set:
            profile photos are always shown.
            Profiles must be screened by admins before
            they are eligible for UOTD.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
        So default_uotd_candidates_query() is the same in either case.

        in case someone else changed since we read it.
        Hopefully this will fix a race condition
        where WU results get sent to different HR classes.
        (Alternatively we could use transactions,
        or acquire the semaphore during read/update,
        but this could impact performance).

    - web: remove all references to the PHP "session" mechanism,
        which added only confusion.
        Implement login directly, using cookies.
    - All cookie setting/clearing now goes through two functions,
        send_cookie() and clear_cookie().
        These deal with path and expiry
        (e.g. if you want to have different language or forum settings
        on two projects on the same server, that now works).
