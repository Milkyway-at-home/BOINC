        as computed by Bruce's update_credit_per_cpu_sec() function
        (finally, a use for hyperbolic trig functions in BOINC).
        Prior to this it was the most recent value of
        claimed credit per CPU sec, which is not as useful.
        Add a new non-DB member to HOST, claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        for this purpose.
    - db_dump.C: export host.credit_per_cpu_sec
    - move update_credit_per_cpu_sec() from lib/util.C to sched/validate_util.C

    Once a few projects pick up this change, it will be useful
    for comparing credit-granting policies between projects
    (for hosts that participate in multiple projects,
    the credit per CPU second should be about the same).

    - core client: fix a bug that could cause computation to stop.
        The problem: if we suspended a task by sending it a <quit/> message,
        we were changing its scheduler state to CPU_SCHED_PREEMPTED
        but not changing its task state (PROCESS_EXECUTING).
        If, for some reason, the process didn't exit right away,
        the scheduler would treat it as still running,
        since it builds its "currently running" list based on task_state.
        Solution: the scheduler shouldn't be looking at task_state.
        Use scheduler_state instead.
        It's still a mystery why the app wasn't quitting.

    - core client: there was logic that wouldn't start a result
        for a project if it had > 2 active uploads
        (intended to prevent an unbounded buildup of files
        for a project whose upload server is broken).
        This was never triggered since the default is 2 active
        transfers per project.
        Maybe I meant persistent file transfers.
        In any case, this is a bad policy because there may be
        a project with lots of output files per result, possibly large,
        and there's no reason to keep it from computing.
        So instead, I changed it to not start a result from a project
        if its number of results in FILES_UPLOADING state exceeds 2*ncpus.

    - Support projects that want to specify credit per WU can do so by:
        1) add a <credit>x</credit> element to your WU template,
            or pass an 'additional_xml' argument containing
            <credit>x</credit> to create_work()
            (either the function or the program)
        2) change your validator so that compute_granted_credit()
            calls get_credit_from_wu().
            This parses the <credit> element in the workunit's XML,
            and grants that much credit.
    - Change the simple validator framework so that an
        additional WORKUNIT& is passed to compute_granted_credit().

David  2 Feb 2007
    - core client: fix bug where client thinks an app is running but it isn't.
        Basic problem: there are two layers
        1) process control: start/stop/suspend/resume, handle exits.
            files: app_*.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::task_state
        2) CPU scheduling: decide what should run
            files: cpu_sched.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::scheduler_state.
        These layers weren't cleanly separated;
        e.g. the CPU sched layer relied on the process control layer
        to set scheduler_state in some cases,
        and this wasn't always being done.
        I fixed this; the layers are now separated.
        Also: added new task_state value, PROCESS_QUIT_PENDING

    - core client: when a scheduler reply has a FILE_INFO for a

         overwrite the file_signature field only if the
         new record actually has one.

         This fixes a bug where a project used the same file in
         both an APP_VERSION and a WORKUNIT.
         The scheduler reply contained two <file_info> elements for the file;
         the first had a signature, the second didn't.
         The second one overwrote the first,
         and the app version was rejected because one its file wasn't signed.

    - scheduler: stop logging error messages about unrecognized
      <no_forum_rating> tag.
    - locality scheduler: when getting a working set file name
      using glob(3), do not glob multiple times, possibly getting
      back the same file name again.  Instead glob once and then
      randomly choose file names, crossing items off the list one
      at a time. Note: I wrote this code using STL vectors and
      strings, but now regret this: the necessary vector insertions
      are potentially inefficient..  Sometime next week I will 
      recode this using a C-style pointer arrays with guaranteed O(1)
      efficiency.  But I want to get this into CVS while it's
      working.

    SANDBOX: only the super-user can send signal to another user's process. 
        Core client runs as user boinc_master, but project applications run 
        as user boinc_project, so ACTIVE_TASK::kill_task() probably could not
        work as written.  I added code which uses switcher helper application 
        to kill the tasks, but also left in the direct kill call just to be 
        safe.
    Note: CBOINCGUIApp::ShutdownBOINCCore() probably has this same problem, 
        but this kill() is only used in extraordinary circumstances. 
     Mac: The Mac screensaver launches the core client if not already running.
        In this case, it used to kill the cc when screensaver was dismissed.
        But Mac OS X dismisses screensavers when energy saver puts displays 
        to sleep, so we want cc to then continue running.  New code launches 
        cc with -saver argument, lets cc run when saver quits.  New logic in 
        cc quits if (launched by screensaver) and (recent user activity) and 
        (parent [screensaver] has exited).  This takes into account that if 
        user invoked screensaver by moving mouse into "hot corner" there will 
        be recent user activity.  Added logic to screensaver to relaunch cc in 
        case of certain race conditions (e.g., screensaver started, dismissed, 
        restarted in rapid succession.)
    - Mac Manager: add -launched_by_manager arg when launching core client.

    A bunch of security-related changes:
    - Most functions that return paths now take an additional
        "length" parameter to prevent buffer overrun if the
        project URL or filename is extremely long.
    - Use snprintf() and vsnprintf() in a bunch of places
        to avoid buffer overrun.
    - Core client: Add suppress_net_info config flag
        (don't send IP address and domain name to servers)
    - Core client: Add disallow_attach config file
        (don't allow attach to new projects)
    - Core client: Add os_random_only config flag.
        (exit if OS-level random string functions fail
        when generating GUI RPC password)
    - Core client: if a filename (in <FILE_INFO>s from server)
        contains directory traversal chars (..),
        or format conversion chars (%),
        or is empty,
        reject it.

    Other changes:
    - Core client: change size of path buffers from 256 to 1024.
        Should make this a #define at some point.
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLISTENTRY -> PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (let's stick with BOINC coding standards)
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLIST -> ALL_PROJECTS_LIST
        (let's not confuse currently attached projects with all projects)
    - GUI RPC: make get_all_projects_list() into an actual RPC,
        not just reading a file (which won't exist in the RPC client's
        current dir, e.g. if it's remote).
    - GUI RPC: rename desc -> description and img -> image
        in project list XML exported by BOINC server.
        Let's NEVER have different spelling between
        XML tabs and structure fields!!
    - GUI RPC: Include rr_sim_deadlines_missed in PROJECT

            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use.
            When the app starts, try to clean out the slot dir.
            If can't clean it out, rename it (to DELETE_ME_*)
            and create another dir.
            On startup, delete dirs named DELETE_ME_*
            The problem: if you can't clean out a dir (on Windows)
            you're not going to be able to rename it.
            So the app will start in a non-empty dir.
        New:
            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use
            and for which an empty directory can be created.
            On start, delete dirs and files not in use by an active task.
    - core client: fix bug where clean_out_dir() could return zero
        even though the dir isn't emptied.

    - Fix compiler warnings. GCC on Linux and Mac have conflicting warnings:
        Mac complains about unused variables, Linux about ignoring returns 
        from functions like getcwd() which returns the result in 2 places.  
        Try to satisfy both compilers using __attribute__ ((unused)) construct.
        This may not work for Windows compiler, though.

    - core client, Unix: run CPU benchmarks at low priority,
        same as applications.
        On some systems, the clock governor (powersaved)
        will slow the CPU clock if nothing's running at regular priority
        (but it ignores processes running at low priority).
        If benchmarks run at regular priority,
        this could result in a erroneous claimed-credit numbers.
