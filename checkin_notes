    - client: use std::deque instead of std::vector
        for RR sim's pending-job lists.
        Erasing head of vector is slow.
    - lib: allow GPU peak FLOPS to be specified in XML (for simulator)
    - simulator work
    - client: old work fetch policy: projects may need enough jobs
        for all device instances, not just resource_share*ninst.
        E.g. a project that has only CPU jobs in a CPU/GPU client
    - client: with REC scheduling, don't ask for work for
        secondary resources if project has negative priority.
    - client: in RR sim, make sure we saturate devices if possible.
        Otherwise we may report a shortfall incorrectly

    - client: set PROJECT::last_upload_start when a job completes,

        good when the text itself is black as well.

    - client: fix job scheduling bug.
        Scenario: we have 2 CPUs and 1GB RAM
        Project A has jobs that use 1GB.
        Project B has small-mem jobs.
        Currently, we ignore RAM usage in building the runnable job list,
        so we might pick 2 jobs from project A.
        enforce_schedule() (which checks RAM usage) will run just one of them,
        and the other CPU will be idle.
        Solution: keep track of RAM usage while building the runnable job list.

    - client: eliminate unnecessary CPU reschedules.
        Currently we do a reschedule any time a job checkpoints,
        in case there's a job that has finished a time slice
        but hasn't checkpointed yet.
        Instead: flag such jobs, and trigger a reschedule
        on checkpoint only for flagged jobs.
    - client: fix instability in job scheduling that happens
        if a job's estimated completion time in RR sim is close to its deadline.
        It can alternate between making and missing deadline,
        causing the scheduler to alternate rapidly between jobs.
        Solution: if RR sim has marked a job as deadline miss
        any time in the last (CPU scheduling period),
        treat it as a deadline miss.
