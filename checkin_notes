    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages
        now have community info in a 2nd column on the right.
        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Mac Client: revert to using older API NXIdleTime() to get user 
        idle time because the newer APIs CGSSecondsSinceLastInputEvent() 
        and CGEventSourceSecondsSinceLastEventType() don't work properly 
        when running as a daemon.
    - Mac: Update script which sets BOINC up to run as a daemon so it 
        works properly under OS 10.5.

    - API: on Mac, call getrusage() from timer thread
        (since calling it from worker thread causes crashes).
        On Linux, call getrusage() from the worker thread
        (since calling it from the timer thread returns zero on some systems).

    - Mac Client: more idle time tweaks to allow running as a daemon by 
        using Mac OS X's launchd mechanism.  
    - Mac Installer: if system is set up to run BOINC Client as a daemon 
        using launchd, use launchctl to launch newly installed Client as 
        a daemon.
