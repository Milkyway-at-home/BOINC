    - scheduler: scan_work_array(): if add_result_to_reply() fails, do NOT
        reinsert the entry in the array by resetting the "present" flag.
        We previously cleared this flag,
        so the array entry may have been refilled by the feeder,
        and it might be in the CHECKED_OUT state.

    - Nasty bug in API lib.  See checkin_nodes_2004 December 22. 
      Functions meant to be used from within C should never be
      declared bool!

      Fix: change boinc_is_standalone() to return int not bool.

      Note: some API functions still return bools, but since E@H
      doesn't use them and I am afraid of doing damage, I have
      left them alone.

    - Tweak the account manager system to support "farm managers"
        that use GUI RPC to control clients.
        The farm manager needs the GUI RPC port and password of each client.
        Add an optional <send_gui_rpc_info/> element to the
        acct_mgr_url.xml file,
        which causes the GUI RPC port and password to be included
        in account manager RPC requests.

David  6 Jan 2006
    - Change "bool" to "int" in the BOINC API.
        C and C++ compilers differ in their allocation for bool,
        making it difficult for C applications
        (which must be compiled with particular compilers)
        to use the BOINC API.
        No such problem for int.

            This is the host CPID sent in the previous AM request.
            It lets the AM track hosts even when their CPIDs change.
        - Include <domain_name> in AM request
        - AM replies can include <message> elements.
            The contents are printed in the Messages tab.

    - user web: show bbcode correctly for UOTD

Bruce 9 Jan 2006
    - fix bug on page that shows profile for a given user.  The total
      number of posts made by a given user is not shown correctly.

      The PHP code assumes that this number is given by user.posts.  However
      in html/inc/db_forum.inc, the value of user.posts is NOT
      incremented each time a user makes a new post (either starting
      a new thread or replying to an existing one).  For the moment, my
      the fix is to simply scan the database and count the number of posts by the
      user, to give the right value on the profile page.

      An alternative fix (which would be less DB intensive, overall)
      is to (1) fix db_forum.inc so that it properly increments user.posts and
      then (2) add an update_db.php script entry that correctly sets user.posts
      by counting the number of posts for each user.

    - Fixes to BOINC zip library from Carl Christensen. Carl says:
      "I found a problem with boinc_zip; it seems some Linux STL's
      aren't very nice about classes that are inherited from their
      objects on multiple use; or huge file lists that we use on CPDN.
      So I rewrite it to just use "straight" std::string's in a vector.
      It's fully backwardly compatible and seems to work fine."

    - Core client: add a flow control mechanism for the case where

        (otherwise we'll fill up the disk).
        The mechanism: don't start new results for a project
        that has > 2 uploads in progress.
        Note: this actually happens with Cunning Plan

    - core client: on file upload, always get file size (even if small file).
        Before the file upload handler checkin earlier today,
        this was actually a bug:
        if a client had uploaded part of a small file and then failed,
        it would never be able to upload the rest.
        But it was probably a bad idea in the first place,
        since 1 MB is a large file from the viewpoint of a modem user.

        Instead, use the PID of the scheduler process that
        has it checked out (as we're already doing for "reserved" slots)
        and let the feeder clean up slots checked out by dead processes.
    - several of the DB enumerate() function were returning
        1 or -1 (rather than ERR_DB_NOT_FOUND) when no results.

    - update_stats program.  Fix 'bug of omission' where member counts
      of teams are calculated but were not written back into the database.
      Also, change algorithm so that for hosts/teams/users, when the RAC
      (Recent Average Credit) values have decayed to exactly 0.0 (double
      precision) then neither expavg_credit nor expavg_time are updated.
      In this way, by looking at the value of expavg_time, you can see
      exactly WHEN the RAC decayed to zero.  This effectively indicates
      the 'drop-out-date' for the host/team/user.

        network connectivity instead of using InternetGetConnectedState
        since it was proving to be unreliable.
        
      NOTE: This is a big change on Windows.  SENS uses COM as it's
        communication infrastructure and so therefore boinc.dll now has
        to be regsvr32'ed before network notification messages will be
        sent to the client.  If, for whatever reason SENS isn't working
        we'll fall back to InternetGetConnectedState.

    -Mac: Improve GridRepublic release script so it uses sed commands 
      to convert standard BOINC plist, preinstall and preupgrade files 
      for Grid Republic; standard BOINC release script creates preupgrade 
      script by copying preinstall script;  these changes eliminate the 
      need for seven files I checked in earlier.
      Also generalize Grid Republic release script so it can easily be 
      modified for other brands by changing a few variable definitions.
      Changed name of GR Manager to "GridRepublic Manager" from just 
      "GridRepublic."
      Restore my change of 1/21/06 which was lost: manager determines 
      branding before launching client.  
      Remove mac_build/Installer-info.plist and replace with 
      mac_build/Installer-info.plist (CVS is case-sensitive).

    - Bug Fix: Overhaul the wizard control creation process.  The RAD tool
        we used broke the process into two parts and arranged things where
        the bulk of the control creation and text assignment happened
        during dialog contruction.  This causes problems since not all of
        the relevant data is available at dialog construction, such as
        account manager name or project name.
        
        The new scheme creates all the controls during dialog creation and
        sets the associated text to null.  When the OnPageChanged event is
        fired we'll go and make all the necessary changes to the control text
        as well as hide and show the correct controls.

    - core client: finish logic for recovering from state file write failures.
        For some reason I'd done the write part but not the read part.
        write:
            1) write "next"
            2) rename "current" to "prev"
            3) rename "next" to "current"
        read:
            if "next" is valid, use it
                (in case failure between 1 and 2)
                In principle we should rename "next" to "current" here,
                but I didn't bother doing this.
            else if "current" is valid use it
                (normal case)
            else if "prev" is valid use it
                (in case 3) failed and file got deleted)

        "is valid" means that the file has a <state_file> tag,

    - Bug Fix: The account manager wizard wasn't actually calling the
        get_project_config routine and so various account manager
        specific settings were not being picked up.
    - Bug Fix: Include the account manager name in the wizard
        communication dialogs if we have it.
    - Bug Fix: Account manager errors were no longer being bubbled
        up to the manager.  The manager was declaring everything a
        success and displaying the success page.
    - Bug Fix: Add 'Account not Found' to the account manager wizard.
    - Bug Fix: Don't attempt an account manager rpc until after a
        proper username and password have been specified.  Various
        attributes in the acct_mgr_url.xml were being nulled out
        since the handle_reply function wasn't properly detecting the
        account not found condition, or any condition where only an
        error number was returned.
    - Bug Fix: Keep the tab graphics consistant across all the
        platforms.

    - Core client: there's a feature where certain GUI RPCs
        enable network communication (if it would otherwise be disabled)
        for 5 minutes or so.
        This set of RPCs was too large.
        Restrict it to things like attach/update project etc.,
        for which network communication is clearly required.
    - core client: parse <want_network> elements in status messages from apps.

    - Allow apps to do cleanup when they're aborted.
        - Add abort_request to BOINC_STATUS structure
        - API library: handle <abort/> message
        - Change boinc_get_status() arg from reference
            to pointer (for easier FORTRAN interface).
            This is an API change, but I think only CPDN uses this.
        - ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll():
            Check for processes that are ABORT_PENDING
            for more than 5 seconds, and kill them

        From Carl Christensen, somewhat modified.
        I changed the way tasks are aborted.
        The core client can't sleep; that locks up the UI.
        So we can't sleep 5 seconds waiting for an app to exit
        after sending it an <abort/> message
        (existing apps don't recognize this message).
        Instead, send it the <abort/> message,
        set its state to PROCESS_ABORT_PENDING,
        and check it from the polling loop 5 seconds later.

    - Core client: when we switched to Curl, we lost the code
        that sets gstate.want_network_flag when name resolution fails.
        I restored this to the Curl code.

    - The above is a kludge for detecting lack of physical connection.
        But name resolution can fail for reasons other than lack of
        physical connection; e.g. hostname might be bad.
        So if get name resolution failure,
        try to contact a reference web site,
        and only if that also fails set want_network_flag.

	- remove "gzip" from list of encodings accepted by Curl;
		having it in the list breaks existing projects
		that use .gz files and decompress them in the app
		(e.g. Einstein and CPDN).
		We can fix this by adding a <gzip/> element in <file_info>; 
		I'll do this later.
	- Remove old HTTP code and data that's deprecated by Curl
		(e.g. timeout, blocksize stuff; stuff related
		to parsing URL into host/port/file/)
		remove commented-out code.
	- GUI RPC: a <file_xfer> elements now includes
		a <url> rather than a <hostname>.
		This change doesn't affect the BOINC Manager,

	- Continuing saga of Curl encodings.
		It seems like if you call set CURLOPT_ENCODING
		with any value, even "identity",
		it will accept any encoding.
		This breaks projects that do application-level gzip.
		Solution: if the filename ends with ".gz",
		don't set CURLOPT_ENCODING.
		Otherwise set it to "" (accept all).
		NOTE: I think this supports current requirements
		(for "deflate" to work, and for app-level gzip to work).
		At some point I'll implement BOINC-level gzip.
	- Fix the format of <error_msg> elements within <file_info>.
		Need a CR between the last line and the </error_msg> tag.
	- In the course of testing I found that a <file_info>
		with no <url>s will crash the core client.
		Fixed this.

Rom    11 Mar 2006
    Problem:  On Windows it seems like random crashes occur with
      the science application is trying to shutdown.

    Cause:  When a science application that supports graphics is
      running on Windows it is generally running with three threads.

        Worker: normally contains the science package and normally
          does the bulk of the memory allocations and de-allocations.

        Graphics: normally just reads what the worker thread has
          produced and displays it in a graphics window.  Memory
          allocations are normally handled on the stack or as
          global variables which are only used via the graphics
          thread.

        Timer: normally handles the IPC to and from the core client.

    When the quit request is received from the core client the timer
      thread would call exit which in turn would cause the C Runtime
      Library to clean up after itself before calling the ExitProcess
      Windows API which would actually stop the threads and exit the
      process.  The thread that calls ExitProcess causes the heaps to
      be freed before the other threads have been stopped.  The
      greater the number of allocations the longer the graphics and
      worker threads are left running and the greater the chance of 
      touching an address of memory that has been freed.

    Solution: Instead of calling exit call TerminateProcess. 
      TerminateProcess causes the OS to halt all executing threads at
      the same time and then starts the shutdown process for the
      process.

        based on host CPID (presumably because user detached/reattached)
        mark all in-progress results as over, client error.
        This prevents them from being resent.
        Avoid a situation where a result causes problems on a host,
        user detaches/reattaches to clear things up,
        and then the host gets sent the same result again.

    - Bug Fix: Multiple load/unloads of boinc.dll messed up the
        idle detection routine.  Removed redundant load/free module
        code so dll is loaded once in beginning, unloaded at program
        end.

    - Let team founders get lists of team members
        (including their email addresses) via XML RPC.
        The URL is PROJECT/team_email_list.php?teamid=X&account_key=Y&xml=1

        This feature lets cross-project teams more easily get their
        combined email-address list.
        It doesn't change BOINC's privacy policy;
        team founders could always get member email addresses.

    - Bug Fix: Since we changed over to async connections the manager has been
        shutting down which ever client is was currently connected to.  So
        wait until we have successfully reconnected to the local BOINC client
        and verify we are connected to the local BOINC client before sending
        the quit command.
