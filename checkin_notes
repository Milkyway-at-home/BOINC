		and download it again.

		if they want to just attach to a single project,

        load and execute it on Windows 2000 or better.
    - Win SETUP: Remove some dead code from the custom action list.
    - Win SETUP: On Windows XP systems or better, we no longer require the
       service account to have a password, Microsoft has taken care of the
       problem by not allowing incomming network connections for accounts with
       no passwords.

        being introduced into properties where no value was defined.
    - Win SETUP: Don't attemp to restore any properties until we have actually
        stored some from a previous iteration of setup, otherwise our defaults
        don't kick in.
    - Win SETUP: Saving and Restoring properties is now only enabled for those
        using the UI deployment method, we don't want to throw anything

        some other deployment mechinism.

    - MGR: Fix crashing issue do to invalid type casts, wxWidgets implements
        its own form of type casts for C++ objects which probably uses
        the basic RTTI of the compiler at some level, but it also has a few
        checks and balences as well. So if you get a hankering of using
        dynamic_cast or static_cast use wxDynamicCast and wxStaticCast
        instead.
    - MGR: Remove the ifdefs for SIMPLE GUI, it is now enabled by default
        on all supported platforms.
