    - VBOX: If VirtualBox reports an error snag both the hypervisor system
        log as well as the VM execution log.  Maybe the hypervisor log
        will tell us what is up with the virtual floppy device.
    - VBOX: Don't retry commands that are expected to fail in normal use
        cases.  It slows down getting the VM up and running.
    - VBOX: After starting the VM, use a timed loop waiting for the initial
        VM state change instead of just waiting for 5 seconds.  Older
        machines can take longer than 5 seconds to switch from poweroff
        to starting.  If we hit the main poll loop in that state the wrapper
        thinks we have crashed.
    - VBOX: Strip carriage returns from all the vboxmanage output on
        Windows.
