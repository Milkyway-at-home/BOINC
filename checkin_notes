    - VBOX: If VirtualBox reports an error snag both the hypervisor system
        log as well as the VM execution log.  Maybe the hypervisor log
        will tell us what is up with the virtual floppy device.
    - VBOX: Don't retry commands that are expected to fail in normal use
        cases.  It slows down getting the VM up and running.
    - VBOX: After starting the VM, use a timed loop waiting for the initial
        VM state change instead of just waiting for 5 seconds.  Older
        machines can take longer than 5 seconds to switch from poweroff
        to starting.  If we hit the main poll loop in that state the wrapper
        thinks we have crashed.
    - VBOX: Strip carriage returns from all the vboxmanage output on

        Weird stuff happens when people start/stop BOINC quickly,
        it looks as though the previous VM instance isn't shutdown before we

    - OpenCL: 
        Problem: Mac OpenCL does not recognize all NVIDIA GPUs returned 
        by CUDA.  Since there is no CAL for Mac, this is not an issue 
        for ATI / AMD GPUs.  On other platforms, the CUDA and CAL drivers 
        also provide OpenCL support, so we don't expect the problem there.
        
        Solution: I believe that CUDA and OpenCL return identical GPU 
        model names for the same GPU, and that both return the GPUs in the 
        same order (but with some possibly omitted from the OpenCL sequence.)
        We use that information to correlate the OpenCL data with CUDA data. 
        We use our internal CUDA device_num for the corresponding OpenCL 
        device, but add a new field opencl_device_index; the two fields are 
        equal unless we have CUDA devices not recognized by OpenCL.  We 
        add a new array opencl_device_indexes[] to the COPROC struct, 
        corresponding to the entries in device_nums[].
        
        The init_data.xml file now has a new field gpu_opencl_device_index.  
        If this field exists, the boinc_get_opencl_ids() API uses this to 
        find the cl_device_id and cl_platform_id, otherwise it continues 
        to use the value in gpu_device_num.

    - client: add a mechanism for restartable download of compressed files.
        (It turns out that the compression schemes supported by
        Apache and libcurl, suprisingly, aren't restartable.)

        if a <file_info> from the server contains <gzipped_url> tags,
        use those instead of the <url> tags,
        and flag the file as "download_gzipped".
        If this is the case, download NAME.gz and save it as NAME.gzt.
        When the download is complete, rename NAME.gzt to NAME.gz,
        and uncompress it to NAME.
        (this ensures that if NAME.gz is present, it's complete).
        Also do the uncompression, if needed, in verify_file().
        This ensures that the uncompression will eventually get done
        even if the client quits are crashes in the middle.

    - update_versions: if <gzip> is present in a <file_info>,
        add a gzipped copy in the download directory
        and add a <gzipped_url> elements to the app version's xml_doc.

    - server: revamp the "assigned job" mechanism.
        This now supports two main use cases:
        1) there's a job that you want to run once on all hosts,
            present and future
            (or all hosts belonging to a user, or to a team).
            The job is never transitioned, validated, or assimilated.
        2) There's a normal job for which you want to use only
            hosts belonging to a specific user (e.g. cluster or cloud hosts).
            This restriction can be made either when the job is created,
            or on the fly,
            e.g. as part of a scheme for accelerating batch completion.
            For the latter purposes we now provide a function
                restrict_wu_to_user(DB_WORKUNIT&, int userid);

            The job goes through the standard
            transitioner/validator/assimilator path.

        These cases are enabled by config flags
            <enable_assignment_multi/>
            <enable_assignment/>
        respectively.

        Assignment of type 2) are no longer stored in shared mem,
        so there is no limit on their number.

        There is no longer a rule that assigned job names must contain "asgn".

        NOTE: this requires a database update.
