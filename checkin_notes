        as computed by Bruce's update_credit_per_cpu_sec() function
        (finally, a use for hyperbolic trig functions in BOINC).
        Prior to this it was the most recent value of
        claimed credit per CPU sec, which is not as useful.
        Add a new non-DB member to HOST, claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        for this purpose.
    - db_dump.C: export host.credit_per_cpu_sec
    - move update_credit_per_cpu_sec() from lib/util.C to sched/validate_util.C

    Once a few projects pick up this change, it will be useful
    for comparing credit-granting policies between projects
    (for hosts that participate in multiple projects,
    the credit per CPU second should be about the same).

    - core client: fix a bug that could cause computation to stop.
        The problem: if we suspended a task by sending it a <quit/> message,
        we were changing its scheduler state to CPU_SCHED_PREEMPTED
        but not changing its task state (PROCESS_EXECUTING).
        If, for some reason, the process didn't exit right away,
        the scheduler would treat it as still running,
        since it builds its "currently running" list based on task_state.
        Solution: the scheduler shouldn't be looking at task_state.
        Use scheduler_state instead.
        It's still a mystery why the app wasn't quitting.

    - core client: there was logic that wouldn't start a result
        for a project if it had > 2 active uploads
        (intended to prevent an unbounded buildup of files
        for a project whose upload server is broken).
        This was never triggered since the default is 2 active
        transfers per project.
        Maybe I meant persistent file transfers.
        In any case, this is a bad policy because there may be
        a project with lots of output files per result, possibly large,
        and there's no reason to keep it from computing.
        So instead, I changed it to not start a result from a project
        if its number of results in FILES_UPLOADING state exceeds 2*ncpus.

    - Support projects that want to specify credit per WU can do so by:
        1) add a <credit>x</credit> element to your WU template,
            or pass an 'additional_xml' argument containing
            <credit>x</credit> to create_work()
            (either the function or the program)
        2) change your validator so that compute_granted_credit()
            calls get_credit_from_wu().
            This parses the <credit> element in the workunit's XML,
            and grants that much credit.
    - Change the simple validator framework so that an
        additional WORKUNIT& is passed to compute_granted_credit().

David  2 Feb 2007
    - core client: fix bug where client thinks an app is running but it isn't.
        Basic problem: there are two layers
        1) process control: start/stop/suspend/resume, handle exits.
            files: app_*.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::task_state
        2) CPU scheduling: decide what should run
            files: cpu_sched.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::scheduler_state.
        These layers weren't cleanly separated;
        e.g. the CPU sched layer relied on the process control layer
        to set scheduler_state in some cases,
        and this wasn't always being done.
        I fixed this; the layers are now separated.
        Also: added new task_state value, PROCESS_QUIT_PENDING

    - core client: when a scheduler reply has a FILE_INFO for a

         overwrite the file_signature field only if the
         new record actually has one.

         This fixes a bug where a project used the same file in
         both an APP_VERSION and a WORKUNIT.
         The scheduler reply contained two <file_info> elements for the file;
         the first had a signature, the second didn't.
         The second one overwrote the first,
         and the app version was rejected because one its file wasn't signed.

    - scheduler: stop logging error messages about unrecognized
      <no_forum_rating> tag.
    - locality scheduler: when getting a working set file name
      using glob(3), do not glob multiple times, possibly getting
      back the same file name again.  Instead glob once and then
      randomly choose file names, crossing items off the list one
      at a time. Note: I wrote this code using STL vectors and
      strings, but now regret this: the necessary vector insertions
      are potentially inefficient..  Sometime next week I will 
      recode this using a C-style pointer arrays with guaranteed O(1)
      efficiency.  But I want to get this into CVS while it's
      working.

    SANDBOX: only the super-user can send signal to another user's process. 
        Core client runs as user boinc_master, but project applications run 
        as user boinc_project, so ACTIVE_TASK::kill_task() probably could not
        work as written.  I added code which uses switcher helper application 
        to kill the tasks, but also left in the direct kill call just to be 
        safe.
    Note: CBOINCGUIApp::ShutdownBOINCCore() probably has this same problem, 
        but this kill() is only used in extraordinary circumstances. 
     Mac: The Mac screensaver launches the core client if not already running.
        In this case, it used to kill the cc when screensaver was dismissed.
        But Mac OS X dismisses screensavers when energy saver puts displays 
        to sleep, so we want cc to then continue running.  New code launches 
        cc with -saver argument, lets cc run when saver quits.  New logic in 
        cc quits if (launched by screensaver) and (recent user activity) and 
        (parent [screensaver] has exited).  This takes into account that if 
        user invoked screensaver by moving mouse into "hot corner" there will 
        be recent user activity.  Added logic to screensaver to relaunch cc in 
        case of certain race conditions (e.g., screensaver started, dismissed, 
        restarted in rapid succession.)
    - Mac Manager: add -launched_by_manager arg when launching core client.

    A bunch of security-related changes:
    - Most functions that return paths now take an additional
        "length" parameter to prevent buffer overrun if the
        project URL or filename is extremely long.
    - Use snprintf() and vsnprintf() in a bunch of places
        to avoid buffer overrun.
    - Core client: Add suppress_net_info config flag
        (don't send IP address and domain name to servers)
    - Core client: Add disallow_attach config file
        (don't allow attach to new projects)
    - Core client: Add os_random_only config flag.
        (exit if OS-level random string functions fail
        when generating GUI RPC password)
    - Core client: if a filename (in <FILE_INFO>s from server)
        contains directory traversal chars (..),
        or format conversion chars (%),
        or is empty,
        reject it.

    Other changes:
    - Core client: change size of path buffers from 256 to 1024.
        Should make this a #define at some point.
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLISTENTRY -> PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (let's stick with BOINC coding standards)
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLIST -> ALL_PROJECTS_LIST
        (let's not confuse currently attached projects with all projects)
    - GUI RPC: make get_all_projects_list() into an actual RPC,
        not just reading a file (which won't exist in the RPC client's
        current dir, e.g. if it's remote).
    - GUI RPC: rename desc -> description and img -> image
        in project list XML exported by BOINC server.
        Let's NEVER have different spelling between
        XML tabs and structure fields!!
    - GUI RPC: Include rr_sim_deadlines_missed in PROJECT

            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use.
            When the app starts, try to clean out the slot dir.
            If can't clean it out, rename it (to DELETE_ME_*)
            and create another dir.
            On startup, delete dirs named DELETE_ME_*
            The problem: if you can't clean out a dir (on Windows)
            you're not going to be able to rename it.
            So the app will start in a non-empty dir.
        New:
            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use
            and for which an empty directory can be created.
            On start, delete dirs and files not in use by an active task.
    - core client: fix bug where clean_out_dir() could return zero
        even though the dir isn't emptied.

    - MGR: Fix variuos performance problems with the Grid based views. Best
        rule of thumb is to not set/change any value in a control unless it
        has really changed. Doing so causes the RECT to become invalidated
        which causes the OS to want to repaint it. Data processing is always
        faster than repainting.

        steps later, you really only need to add or delete the difference
        since the last update.
    - MGR: Avoid using 'wxString("Some static Text", wxConvUTF8)' to handle
        literal strings for Unicode, the wxT() macro allows the compiler to
        take care of it at compile time, instead of run-time.

            been assimilated or is overdue
            (i.e. there's a chance of not getting credit)
            send <result_abort_if_not_started>
    - Scheduler: enhancements to replication policy
        (which attempts to send additional replicas of a WU
        only to reliable/fast hosts).
        There are several new config options which let projects
        tailor the policy in various ways:
        - <reliable_min_avg_credit>: a host must have at least
            this avg credit to be considered reliable
        - <reliable_max_avg_turnaround>: a host must have at most
            this avg_turnaround to be considered reliable
        - <reliable_on_priority>: results with at least 
            this priority will be sent only to reliable hosts
        - <reliable_priority_on_over>:
            increase priority of additional replicas by this amount
        - <reliable_priority_on_over_except_error>
            increase priority of additional replicas
            triggered by timeout (but not error) by this amount
        - <reliable_time>: send results for WUs at least this old
            only to reliable hosts
        - <reliable_reduced_delay_bound>: if a WU is at least
            "reliable_time" old, multiply its latency bound
            by this factor (0..1)
    - Transitioner: add the notion of "grace period"
        so users get credit even if results are somewhat late.
        - <grace_period_hours>: defer the deletion of
            the canonical result for this many hours
            after the deadline of any pending result
    - Transitioner: add option <delete_delay_hours>:
        delay the deletion of WU input files for this
        interval after last result has been returned

    Implementation details::
    - add TRANSITIONER_ITEM::res_received_time
    - add WORK_ITEM::res_priority
        (read by feeder, stored in shared mem, used by scheduler)
    - add IN_PROGRESS_RESULT to enumerate in-progress results
    - read appid in VALIDATOR_ITEM
    - add priority_increase arg to create_result()

    (all the above from Kevin Reed)

    - core client: fix bug where, if client runs at boot time
        and DNS system isn't up yet,
        entries in remote_hosts.cfg will fail to resolve,
        and the core client will be inaccessible.
        Fix: we already have a mechanism in which GUI_RPC_CONN_SET::init()
        is called 30 times, at 1-sec interval, until it succeeds.
        Extend this to cover the parsing of remote_hosts.cfg also.

    - Mac: fix Mac Stuffit file corrupted in switch from CVS to Subversion.
    - Mac: Update backtrace to use entirely new code from Apple Developer 
        Technical Support.  The format is now compatible with OS X's 
        built-in Crash Reporter, and is ready for 64-bit Mac Intel 
        applications (which will be available in OS 10.5).  If the backtrace 
        is from a stripped application, the output of this new code can be 
        run through a new shell script (available on Apple's web site) to 
        add symbols to it from a separate symbol file - this is a very useful 
        feature.  For details, see comments in mac_backtrace.h.
        
        Note: We build the PowerPC applications with GCC-3.3 to be backward 
        compatible with OS 10.3.0 - 10.3.8, and GCC 3.3 does not support 
        64-bit applications, and Apple discontinued production of PowerPC 
        Macs in 2006, so this backtrace code does not support 64-bit PowerPC 
        G5 applications.

      project-specific workunit id so that a user's contribution
      can be tied to the appropriate workunit ID in the science
      database (a different ID than in the BOINC database). This logic
      is only enacted with -update_wuhash flag on command line.

      in the workunit.opaque field.

    - Core client: handle multiple platforms correctly.
        Remove the tacet assumption that a host can handle
        applications for a single platform.
        With the Apr 30 scheduler changes,
        a project may (at different times)
        send app versions for the same app and version number,
        but different platforms.
        Before we would have ignored all but the first;
        now we handle them correctly.

        Implementation notes:
        - Add APP_VERSION.platform, RESULT.platform,
            and RESULT.version_num.
            If these are missing from an XML doc
            (e.g. an existing state file or a scheduler reply
            from a project not running current server)
            then set to the primary platform.
        - Continue to write workunit.version_num
            and active_task.version_num to state file,
            even though these are no longer part of the struct.
            This allows users to revert to an older version.

    - scheduler: in send_result_abort(), distinguish between
        the enumeration ending versus it failing.
        This fixes a bug where lots of results would be
        incorrectly aborted if there's a database problem.
        This fix only matters if you use the <send_result_abort> config flag.
        (from Kevin Reed)
    - validator: add -credit_from_wu option.
        This gets credit from the workunit XML
        (which must have a <credit> flag).

        (sample_bitwise and sample_trivial)

    - Finally fixed a long-standing bug which caused the PieCtrl legend to 
        be clipped to a small rectangle when first drawn on Macs.  If the 
        legend changed so it required more space, this bug would also clip 
        to the former size the first time it was updated.  This problem 
        did not occur on Windows.
        NOTE: I currently can't build on Windows or Linux, so please verify 
        that my modified code works OK on those platforms. 
    - Mac: removed the hack which refreshed once a second the first 3 times

    - A better fix for Mac PieCtrl legend clipping bug: wxPieCtrl::Refresh() 
        calls new wxPieCtrlLegend::MeasureText() method to caclulate size of 
        the legend area and SetSize() of legend window before OnPaint() is 
        called.  Apparently, calling SetSize() from within the OnPaint() 
        function doesn't adjust the "invalid" area to be repainted until 
        a return to the event loop, so the added area didn't get painted 
        until the next OnPaint() call.  Also, the wxMemoryDC bitmap was 
        being created at the smaller size, so that was also clipping the 
        drawing.
    - Mac: include size of BOINC Manager bundle in BOINC total disk usage
