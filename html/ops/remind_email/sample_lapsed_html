Dear <name/>:

<p>
We notice that you've contributed computing power to Test Project,
but that we haven't yet credited you with any completed work
in the last <lapsed_interval/> days.
Your computing power is important to Test Project,
and we hope that you resume computing with us soon.
If you had problems running the software,
please visit the
<a href=http://a.b.c/forum_help_desk.php>Questions and Answers</a>
area of our web site.
You may find the solution to your problem there;
if not, you can ask for help from project volunteers and staff.

<p>
We also encourage you to fill out the
<a href=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/poll.php>BOINC user survey</a>
to give us feedback on how to make Test Project more easy and fun to use.

<p>
Thanks --
<p>
The staff of Test Project
