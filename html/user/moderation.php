To maximize discussion and flow of information,
our message boards are moderated.
Message board postings are subject to the following posting rules:
".post_rules()."
Moderators may delete posts that violate any of these rules.
The authors of deleted posts will be notified via email.
Gross offenders may have their accounts disabled to prevent further posting.

<p>
If you think a post violates any of the posting rules,
click the red X on the post and fill out the form;
moderators will be notified of your complaint.
<p>
We try to be as fair as we can when moderating,
but in a large community of users, with many different viewpoints,
there will always be some people that will not be happy
with our moderation decisions.
While we regret that this happens,
please realize that we cannot suit all of the people all of the time
and have to make decisions based on what is best for the forum overall.

<p>
This moderation policy is set by the ".PROJECT." project.
If you have comments about the policy, email ".SYS_ADMIN_EMAIL.".
